The replacement battery arrived on time but it did not fit easily into my Motorola V557 phone like the original battery does. When I got it in, put the back on the phone, and connected the charger, the phone indicated that it could not charge the battery. I contacted Bargaincell and they offered a refund if I return the battery prepaid. This seems reasonable except that the packaging and shipping cost about as much as the battery (only $1 less). I don't mind paying it once to get the battery but I'm not about to pay it again to return the battery.
