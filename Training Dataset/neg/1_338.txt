If you have any sense, don't buy this phone. I paid $700 for this phone when it first came out. After the first three months the mouth piece went dead. I got another one and it went all staticy so I had to send it back. The camera has never taken a decent picture and recently I dropped it and the screen damaged. I called to get it repaired and they want to charge me $179. That's almost $1000 for a cell phone. I ask you, who doesn't drop their cell phone at least once?
