I started my Verizon account with 4 razors. All had the same problems and none were recalled. You can count on the front screen glass breaking. The our phones were not durable and all have been replaced. BAD PHONE CHOICE. I always liked Motorola until now. I will never buy a Motorola product again. AND... Verizon was no help. After a month the phone broke and I had to file an insurance claim because it was not honored by warranty because they use the date of your first phone. Buyers Beware. Ask lots of questions.
