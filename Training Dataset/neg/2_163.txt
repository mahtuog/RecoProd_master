I've had this phone for under a year. It has some great features for sure! I really liked the pink color and I am over 30. From the begining, everyone I spoke to on the phone said they could not hear me unless I spoke loudly into the bottom of the phone which was quite annoying esspecially in public. Then one day no one could hear me at all. I tried everything including reseting the phone, nothing worked. I am now in the market for a new phone in less than a year, what a waste.
