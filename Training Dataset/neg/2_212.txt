Okay, I'll be nice, the thing does look good and the sound is exceptional (transmission and reception), but the comfort level, which was what I thought would be great coming from Body Glove, was horrible. I twisted and bent the arm that goes behind your ear to perfection and I still never felt like it was going to stay in place. The thing is VERY light, which should be a good thing but I felt it moving every time I did. Finally the darn thing just fell apart. One minute I am talking...I get home, tell my friend I will call him back, I disconect it from my phone and go to take it off my ear to find that the receiver bit is still in my ear!!! To the trash it went. Buy the. Yes it looks wierd but it fits, sounds great and the rubbery ear thing rarely comes off. It does come off but not enough to bug. Either way avoid this product.
