It is a really nice case. The keyboard can not be used unless removing the phone from the case. This can't be accomplished easily. You must remove the entire apparatus from your belt, and pull the phone out. The case is so tight that when you take the phone from the case to use the keyboard, the case pulls the battery cover off. If you do not use the keybaord on a daily basis this is your case. If it is used daily, find something else. It also has plastic over the screen so to use the stylus it must be removed as well. If you are using the phone only, then get this case, otherwise, this goes in the box with the other 20 unusable cell phone cases I have aquired for this device.
