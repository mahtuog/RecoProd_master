Their DEFECTIVE product caused my palm tx to BREAK! I used the armor case and the belt clip that came with it the very day I got the package. My palm fell on the ground! Turns out the screw at the back of the armor case which was attatched to the belt clip was loose. Now my palm is broken. I emailed boxwave and this is the reply I got: "Our liability policy prevents us from providing additional compensation for it. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you."- All they offered was to replace the DEFECTIVE armor case with another one. As if I would ever trust their product again!!!
