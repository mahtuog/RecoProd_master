Having owned two of the Body Glove Earglove Headsets, I would not purchase another one. Both of mine broke after a few weeks of use. Either the boom snapped off or the ear connector broke off where the boom connects to the headset. I'm very careful with my cell phone and related items, handling each with care. Poor design.
