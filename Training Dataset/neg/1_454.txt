Let's start with the bad things:1: There's no way this battery will ever give 2 weeks of standby time in the real world. When I first got it, about 7 months ago, it would give 5-6 days. Not bad, but a far cry from the "1-2 weeks" that was promised.2: It decays fast. 7 months ago I could get 5-6 days of standby time. This battery has now been reduced to being 1-2 days. The "zero memory effect" claim is also worthless.Personally, I'd avoid the SCH-3500 at all costs. While it seems like it should be a decent phone, it has a myriad of problems. I'm currently on my second, the first one died after less than a year of very light use. Pick a different phone and battery system.
