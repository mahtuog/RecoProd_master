The battery worked fine, for a while. But within a month of purchase the connection plate quite literally split off from the battery and rendered it useless. Granted I use two batteries (to allow complete discharge/recharge cycling) so they're pulled in and out of my phone often, but the original battery is still going strong and this one fell apart.Truth be told I probably got my money's worth out of this battery and you probably will to, but don't expect that $5 to get you very far.
