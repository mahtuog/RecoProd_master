I thought I finally found the perfect cell phone accessory - a battery with a belt clip; not one of those cheap after-market kits that are sold everywhere.My only dissapointment was in finding out that while the clip worked great, the battery wouldn't hold a charge.Let's see if the replacement works better.Stay tuned . . .
