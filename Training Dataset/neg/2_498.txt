I used this product for a few days and I returned it right away. I have had difficulty finding a bluetooth headset that was loud enough to hear while driving my car. I have had other models where the earpiece stayed outside of the ear canal and after hearing this model goes in your ear, I thought I'd give it a try. Initially, it seemed loud enough but what really bothered me about it was the static. I would have my phone on my belt on my right side of the body and this ear piece on my left ear. Whatever I did, I would always hear static and the calls were never clear. I tried putting the phone on the same side as the head set and it was a bit better but I'm accustomed to the location of my phone and headset and am unwilling to pay nearly $100 for this.
