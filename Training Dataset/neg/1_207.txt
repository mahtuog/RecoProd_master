Since this is called a &quot;travel&quot; charger - you would expect that it would be used to charge your phone in a car - WRONG! This charger plugs into a regular wall socket. But how would you know that if you can't see a photo of the item? And since there is a photo missing, I should think that Amazon would have included a much more complete description of this item - saving me the time and trouble of returning it - since an exact replica of this item was included with my phone!
