The V600 model was originally designed for AT&T. Due to the AT&T/Cingular merger, Cingular decided to take this model as well. However, Cingular could not get the phone to fully work on their 850Mhz network. That is why they started replacing the phones of their V600 customers for V400 models. All this corrective process (call it recall, if you wish) is carried out by Cingular exclusively. As per the phone itself, the V600 is not being recalled or discontinued by Motorola but is being recalled and discontinued by Cingular. It is just Cingular's network that is not capable of supporting this model. An easy way to test this is to try and activate this phone through AT&T: it will experience no difficulties whatsoever. Motorola will repair the phone, if necessary, and return it to you fully functional. However, if you wish to receive a replacement unit, you will need to contact Cingular. A new Motorola model is currently in development to replace the V600. The new model will be very similar to the V600 model.
