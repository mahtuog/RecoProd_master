You can see why they have fancy colour earpieces for this thing - they have to find something to appeal to you about it.I turned it in every conceivable orientation and never found a good fit to my ear. (In case you ask, I would describe my ears as &quot;average&quot; or &quot;normal&quot;). A diagram on the packaging would have saved much frustration on that score.But NOTHING will compensate for the fact that the built-in microphone function is utterly useless. I thought maybe it was just me - but two friends also got suckered into buying one of these, and their cellphone calls went from reasonable to completely unintelligible.Do not, repeat NOT, buy this product.
