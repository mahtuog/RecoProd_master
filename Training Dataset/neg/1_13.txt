I have a jawbone headset, before I have read some review on the website everyone is recommend to buy the jarbra eargel to go with my jawbone, I found that is very untrue, before I was using with the hook, my jawbone never fell out of my ear, but when I first wear my jawbone with eargels. it kept on fell out of my ear. so I stop using them, to me a a waste of money, I like my jawbone the way it is. and it's comfortable for my usage as well. could be happy than that.
