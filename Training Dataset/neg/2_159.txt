Not too much to say about a product like this, but I tried this brand and found them hard to apply and inferior quality. I threw them out and bought the (mroe expensive) Palm brand "Anti-Glare screen protectors" and am elated. It was easy to apply and you can clear the fingerprints off of them. The Palm ones were more expensive but a much better product - I've had the same one on my Treo for 7 months now and don't see why I'd ever need to replace it.
