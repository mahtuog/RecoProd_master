I've used the headset for a little over a year and, although plagued with disconnects when idle, was relatively pleased with the sound quality. Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance. There was no notice when it disconnected. Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed that,since it was over the one year warranty, my only option would be to purchase a new headset; a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies.Logitech's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant.
