This phone is the worst and most expensive phone I have ever owned (I got it before it was free). It has horrible reception and it drops calls left and right especially in areas of higher density. The clarity of almost all my calls is incredibly bad. It scrathes very easily. Vibrate only works on the loudest ring or no ring (nothing's wrong with it, that's just the way the phone is) and the ring tones are very hard to hear unless you pick one of the loud annoying ones. It doesn't tell me when I have voicemail messages. Voicemail doesn't work half the time. There's no voice recorder or loud speaker. You can't see the screen in the sunlight. Speed dial is a pain because you can't press the number then the call button, you HAVE to hold the key down, which doesn't sound like much, but if you've had a phone that worked differently, it's annoying. There's no snooze on the alarm. The sim card takes forever to load when you turn on the phone. The battery life is so short if you talk a lot (Four hours talk time). I'm a college student and my phone is my main source of calls and I have to charge this phone almost every day and I have to take the phone charger with me even if I'm gone just for the weekend. I'm very unhappy with this phone. I wouldn't even get an LG again.
