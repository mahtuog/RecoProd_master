This phone was cheap for an unlocked GSM phone and it showed. The user interface was now easy to use, features were very minimal, the audio quality from the phone was poor and hard to hear in noisy environments, ringer was hard to hear, etc. Oh, if you use an ear piece, your phone will not ring...only through the ear piece. :( Some good things about the phone? It is small, cheap, and it works to the best of its ability.
