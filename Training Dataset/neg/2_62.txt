Overall I liked the case, but as two people previous to myself pointed out the belt clip falls out too easily. Within two weeks of purchase the soft leather that was supposed to hold the plastic tab in place had stretched to the point where it was freely rotating. After less then two months, it plastic tab falls out entirely, dropping the phone to the ground at inconvenient moments.It looks like I'll be looking for another case again.
