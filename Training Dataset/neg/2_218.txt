Sigh... I bought this product after having read the first review on this page. I WAS a happy customer. The earpiece was comfortable like no other, I could hear all of my calls, crystal clear. I loved it. But to my dismay, all of the people I called complained that it was very difficult to hear me. I would call from my car or in a room and all complained of a &quot;windy and static&quot; noise. A noise so loud that most of them didn't want to continue that conversation. 'nuff said?Too bad I'll be returning this one. None of the other pieces have been this comfortable.
