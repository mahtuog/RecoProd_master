My wife wanted one of the new Bluetooth phones, and of course that meant her hands free car kit would no longer work. So the choice was to buy her a cordless hands free headset or another several hundred to install a new car kit. After a protracted review process, I chose the Jabra 250 as it seemed to be the most comfortable to wear and it seemed to have the best volume incoming and outgoing as well from what we looked at on the market, even though it is only using Bluetooth 1.1. Now that we bought it, I'm blown away, this unit is truly amazing. We are using it on the new Moto MPx 220 and it works like a champ. You hardly notice that you are even wearing it, and it has enough incoming volume to blow you away if you don't turn it down. Outgoing volume is good as well. The unit would have received a 5 star rating if it was using Bluetooth 1.2. What I have determined after reading many reviews that were great and those that said the unit was not very good, is that I tend to believe it has to do with the phone it is matched up to. A new high quality phone should work great with this as it does for us. Hope this helps and thanks for all the reviews I was able to read to get me to this point.
