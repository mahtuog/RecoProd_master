I purchased this phone as a replacement for my slvr L2. it has better features...camera,new sleek look,added software. i fully charged it. inserted my sim card, and everything was working fine until i tried to place a call. I found i could place calls but shortly after connecting it would drop the call. so after contacting tech support they said i needed to get a new sim card and it might fix the problem. so i drive 15 mins down the road and get a new sim card just to find out that it doesnt change anything, still having dropped calls. in the end ATT said that it was the phone and it was most likley due to the fact that it was unlocked. ill never buy a unlocked phone again. as far as the phone itsself it worked fine,however im happy that i already had a motorola charger because the one that was sent in the box with the phone was european. i ended up sending it back to mobilecity and only getting a fraction of what i paid for it, due to the dumb restocking fee. so to cut this short, make sure your service provider supports unlocked phones before purchasing!!
