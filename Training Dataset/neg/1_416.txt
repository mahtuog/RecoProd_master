I'm in the middle of my pregnancy, so I really need a car charger!Amazon's description said this model was compatible with my NOKIA6102 flip cell phone, but it isn't it has the standard regular size tip for charging, which would work with most NOKIA cell phones prior to the NOKIA 6102 flip phone! The NOKIA 6102 flip cell phone has a new smaller charger end, so with all due respect might I suggest that someone grab a NOKIA 6102 flip cell phone, and the above car charger to see that they are "NOT" compatible, to help prevent this in the future! Because I am still pregnant and I still need a car charger, for my NOKIA 6102 cell phone!I due honestly appreciate the fact that Amazon at least paid for the return shipping, since the charger wasn't compatible!
