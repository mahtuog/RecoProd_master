(Note: I tried this with a Nokia 5150. Your mileage may vary.)Comfort is poor. Getting it to fit snugly takes a bit of practice, and the ear bud starts to get uncomfortable after 5 to 10 minutes.Reception is OK. Sound is loud and clear, but seems to be susceptible to interference from other RF devices (portable phone, stereo, computer, etc.)Transmission is very bad. I tried calls to several different people. All complained that they could barely hear me speak. I finally gave up on it.Styling is great, but that really doesn't make any difference when you can't use it.
