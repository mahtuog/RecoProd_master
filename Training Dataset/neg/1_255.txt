I bought this phone with a one-year plan. I had an existing month-to-month plan with Verizon. Amazon assured me that although I would get a new phone number with the new phone, a simple call to Verizon would get my existing cell phone number switched to the new phone.WRONG. Verizon told me that they could never do that. So essentially Amazon customer service screwed me over. I will never trust them again.You might get by this problem by switching to a prepaid plan.
