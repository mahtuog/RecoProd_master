My fiance and I both purchased one of these phones about a year ago. My screen went completely black about two-three months ago and now his is slowly fading. The phone still works fine, but forget about reviewing missed calls, viewing your phone book, changing your ringtone....it is pretty much a useless phone. I thought my phone was an accident, but now that his is non-functioning I know it is LG's fault. Don't waste your money, you will need to replace it.
