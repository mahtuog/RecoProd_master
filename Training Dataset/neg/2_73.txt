The case for this model looks great in the picture, but mine was scratched and looked bad after putting it on my phone. I originally wanted to preserve the stylish black of my new pearl, but this case did not do that for me. The clip on the back also broke after a few weeks time. Also, dust will definitely get between the clip and your phone if keep it in your pocket.EforceCity offered to replace the product or provide me a refund if I changed the review, but this product was only a few bucks so I'd rather post an honest review of the product and deal with the faults of this product.This thing is still on my phone after 4 months, but only because I am prone to dropping it when I go out.Spend money on a better case or a scratch resistant clear adhesive for the display of your phone (which I also purchased).
