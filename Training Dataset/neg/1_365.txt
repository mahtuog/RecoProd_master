I had this product for two weeks and starting having problems. Blinking yellow LED, solid green LED during charging, but it would not hold a charge. Finally a solid blue LED before its death. LED operation was not described in operator's manual, so I had no idea how to troubleshoot this problem. I sent 3 E-Mails to Boxwave customer service, and have not received any response. I got their phone number (425) 828-6641 from the BBB, but their voice mailbox is full. Really? Who sells a defective product and completely ignores its customers? Boxwave will probably be out of business in a year, because customers don't tolerate this type of service. Stay away from Boxwave!
