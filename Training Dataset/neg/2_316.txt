I bought this fm transmitter about 6 months ago and was fairly satisfied. It was a little more expensive than I thought it should be for the basic features it has, but I decided to give it a chance. The sound quality wasn't excellent but was well above what you would get from a cheap device, and the signal strength was really good. From what I've written one would think it would be a 4 star device, and it would be have been had it not shorted out 6 months after I bought it.I take care of my electronics so I know it wasn't excessive force or abuse that did it in. Now whenever I try to use it if the move the cable even the slightest bit the left speaker cuts out, very frustrating.
