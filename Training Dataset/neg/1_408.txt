that was one piece of junk that i wish i never bought. it looked really cool in the picture but once i got it and started using it people would always ask what was wrong with my phone. the sound quality was like talking through a pillow they'd say, and it was constantly breaking up. i used it for two days and then gave up on it.waste of money guys.
