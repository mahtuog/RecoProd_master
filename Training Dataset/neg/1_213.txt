Not worth the money. Under normal use, wearing it on my belt :-) duh, it broke in less than a month. The plastic pin that allows you to swivel the holster is the weak link. The case itself is great, soft leather but the cheap plastic swivel design is poor. Go buy a Blackberry Silicone Skin case instead to protect the blackberry and then pick up an after market cheap holster at Wal Mart and you'll be much happier..
