I have 2 of these headsets for a Sony Ericsson t637.I second other reviewers regarding poor range. The phone has to be in line of sight, within a few feet. If the phone is in mypant pocket, reception is marginal.Also: I am unable to use it to record my voice tags. I have read other reviews compalining about this.When I am voice dialing a phone book entry with multiple numbers,I do not get any audio feedback that the phone is waiting for meto say(e.g) "home" or "work" to select one of the numbers.I find it pratically unusable for voice dialing while driving.I guess for better voice tag matching, you would have to record your voice tags in the car, using the Jabra which seems to beout (see above).Oh by the way, the phone uses battery power at a much faster ratewhen connected to the headset, i.e enabling bluetooth increasespower consumption.
