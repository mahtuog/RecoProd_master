No...just...no.I was excited to try this the keyboard out. The case itself is actually ok. It's a little blocky, but hey, what do you expect when you connect a keyboard to your iphone? I actually like the design. With that said, I had problems plugging the USB into the case, and also had sync problems after charging the keyboard fully. The spacebar on the keyboard does not click, so you never knew when you pressed the space or not. I often found myself clicking it two or three times...I also thought the keyboard was sort of flimsy and felt "cheap". This probably has to do with the fact they wanted to keep weight down, but I felt like if I dropped the phone with the keyboard open that it would break very easily.I think with some tweaks this keyboard case could be awesome, but this model isn't for me. It's not worth $80. At most I'd pay $45 for an item like this. With improvements it could be worth the $80, but as it is now...no...go another route.One big positive are the customer service people at BoxWave. I ordered my item directly from BoxWave, and the return process was easy and straight forward.
