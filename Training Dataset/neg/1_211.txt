It took 2 weeks to receive the wrong item. I sent an e-mail to customer service and it was another 2 days before they responded. They did fix the mistake, quickly sending the correct item and a return label for the incorrect item. The case itself is great; very secure.One caution, I have been keeping my Pearl in the case full time for about a week and I'm now noticing a dark spot on the screen where the magnetic closure may have affected the screen's pixels. My recommendation would be to keep the pearl in the case as little as possible (only when it's on your belt).
