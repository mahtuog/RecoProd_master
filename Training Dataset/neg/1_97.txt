I'm writing a review for the first time because I've never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience. I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts. I ordered them on December 5th. It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped! It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [Amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] Needless to say, I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts. This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(I can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! They also shipped them seperately. A sign of inefficiecy, indeed. One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. I've decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again.
