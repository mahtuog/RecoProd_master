I bought the silver version and this product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made.
