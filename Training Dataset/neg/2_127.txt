The Krusell Classic Multidatp case for Blackberry 7130e looks good. However, it is seriously lacking in what is the most important feature - access to the trackwheel. The cutout which allows access to the trackwheel is entirely too small - and I am a female with very small fingers. I plan to return this case and instead invest in screen guards and carrying case.
