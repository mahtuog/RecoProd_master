The earpiece may fit comfortably and even sound pretty good, however the microphone is not aceptable. I find that I have to speak way too loudly in order for the other person to hear what I am trying to say. Either I talk so loud that everyone around me hears my conversation or the person I'm calling can't hear me well enough. This is not an item I would recommend to anyone unless you really want to annoy anyone within 10 feet of you.
