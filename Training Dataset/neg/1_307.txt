I got this exact same case on EBay, for about 90% less. And the one on EBay was even constructed better. The cut-outs were all in line. I figured since this one cost more, the material would be 'better'? "FALSE" I ordered two of these from the same seller. Two different colors, and the materials, and the cutouts did not match. Save your money, go to EBay, and get a better much cheaper case than what is listed here. I have already emailed for an RMA on both cases.
