I bought this product to replace a similar unit of different manufacture. The old unit started making noise through any radio I used, and I finally tossed it. I tried this Monster FM transmitter specifically because the reviews I read about it seemed to point to its quietness and low background noise. On the several radios I played my XM unit output on through this transmitter, all of them emitted a high pitched whine using it. I returned it for a refund. Maybe I just got the lemon out of the bunch? Other than the whine, it was very simple to use and clear to read.
