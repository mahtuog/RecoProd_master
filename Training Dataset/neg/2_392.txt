Well, so far I can't tell you how it works, because the one that arrived doesn't work. It wouldn't take a charge. That brings me to the charger. My previous Motorola phone and headset charger were interchangeable, that is, you could use the charger for both the phone and the headset. I assumed this would be the case in ordering another Motorola headset for my new phone. Sadly, it is not. The charger adapter plug is not a micro-USB, and only works for the headset.This is also similar to other Motorola headsets that don't have an ear plug built into the receiver, so it sits outside the ear, instead of in the ear. This may affect your purchase.It does come with two other ear hooks, which I thought was nice.
