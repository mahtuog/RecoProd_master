This case is beautifully crafted and very well made. But it does definitely have some serious design flaws. The opening to access the charging port is on the WRONG SIDE OF THE PHONE. So you have to remove the case to recharge the phone. Also, the flap that goes over the flip portion of the phone obsures the camera lens (But don't they all?) and is so tight that it holds the flip constantly open. Within an hour of receiving this item, I had cut off the flip cover with a pair of scissors. Hated doing that, but the last two complaints were then fully eliminated immediately. The strap that covers the key pad still holds the phone in the case securely. And, actually, I think it even looks better without the beauty of the phone being obscured by the case flap.
