When it comes to owning gadgets, this baby is a must. It can do so much - the camera is fun, the organizer is pretty good, the color screen is excellent, bluetooth has show-off swagger and connectivity and the games are a lot of fun. The downside, this is certainly not a great phone. Its signal reception is mediocre and it suffers from a weird combination: the user of the phone comes through extremely loud on the other side, while the T610 user can barely hear what the other person is saying. This makes you talk even louder, thinking you are not heard and you get the picture. Being so small, the phone also requires you to either put it close to your ear or close to your mouth. In summary - in every non-phone activity this is a superb device, but as a phone it is middling.
