In a nutshell: Verizon has made this phone mediocre. If you gotta have a V3m, get one from another carrier.The Razr V3m's sharp looks, respectable battery life and fidelity are marred by Verizon's sluggish interface and crippled features. If all you want is a thin profiled phone, then you'll probably be happy with this item - and many places offer them up for free. But those searching for a "media" rich phone should keep looking.The "IN" calling feature can save you a bundle if friends and family are Verizon subscribers. BUT...If you are at all interested in customizing the V3m with ringtones, wallpaper and such, be prepared to hand fistfulls of cash to the VCAST service or spend oodles of time trolling the net for info on hacks (of which there are plenty - for Windows users).The built-in camera is just okay. With the placement of the lens near the hinge you're bound to end up with an index finger in many a shot. The same holds true for the video camera feature - not that you'll use it much since its record time is limited to 15 seconds.You can playback .wma files stored on a transflash card (that's next to the battery that must be removed to access the card) but there's no 3.5mm headphone port; A USB dongle adapter is in box. Note: the largest card you can use is a 1GB.No USB cable is included despite the V3m's disabled OBEX feature (which allows the transferring of files via bluetooth). Razrs from Sprint, T-Mobile, Cingular an All-Tell have this feature intact!pros:compact sizerespectable sound qualitycan check voicemail from another phonecons:Many important wireless functions disabled!
