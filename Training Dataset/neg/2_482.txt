I have been a T-Mobile subscriber for a couple of years. I recently got this phone and compared to my older Samsung S105, this phone has a horrible reception. Also, a lot of times you just lose the network and have to manually select the network.A phone's main functionality is talking. There's no use in packing all the functionality if you cannot talk/hear clearly.
