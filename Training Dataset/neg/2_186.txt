The PDA features work well. Syncs up easily with computer. However, phone reception is terrible. Admittedly, I live in a fringe area but the old Sanyo 8100 worked just fine on the Sprint network. Even bought external antenna to improve reception and stop dropped calls but did no better. Ready to sell and start over.
