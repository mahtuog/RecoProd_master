I've been using the Jabra Universal EarSet for the last week with a Motorola Talkabout phone. The incoming call quality is very clear, but background noise will play a tremendous part in how well your voice is picked up. You'll sound very clear in a quiet environment-your home, office, suburbs, etc. With a television on, things can get muddled. Outdoors in a city during rush hour is terrible, requiring you to cup your ear to give your voice any kind of quality.Technology-wise, it's impressive how well the EarSet works, but for urbanites on the go, there are better products out there.
