My experience with this accessory is making dislike the Nokia brand even more. Why can't they just make an earpiece that works on ALL Nokia phones? But no, that would be too easy and customers would not be forced to buy new accessories when they upgrade their phones. Anyhow, I did an Amazon search for my phone model and this one was the first to pop up on the list when sorted by relevance, so I assumed it would work on my phone. What a stupid mistake. Maybe I should have done more due diligence and read the whole description list, but when something not compatible pops up FIRST that is deceiving.
