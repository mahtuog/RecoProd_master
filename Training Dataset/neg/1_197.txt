I received this product as a gift ordered from Amazon.com. I was pleased for the most part with the features and analog sound quality. Since the A2DP profile is not available for many devices yet, I cannot make use of the Bluetooth stereo connectivity that this phone allows. I have an LG VX8100 by Verizon, which is a great phone. I just wish I could find a great binaural bluetooth headset/headphone that works completely in stereo or at least provides a 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm adapter that would allow me to listen to the mp3s on my phone through the headset. I would have been able to live with the few limitations of the device until I realized that there is a design flaw that will no doubt affect anyone who purchases this headset. I noticed a hairline fracture on one side of the headset after less than two months of careful use. The single fracture became a dual fracture on the same side and I realized I needed to return them for a replacement. I figured this was a design flaw but I liked them enough to try another pair. Lo and behold, the same thing has started to happen again.I cannot give an otherwise very good product a formidable rating when there was so little emphasis placed on the design and durability factor of a headset that costs over $100. Now I just want a refund so I can purchase a Motorola HT820 and DC800 adapter. At least it looks like Motorola thought about making a product that can be used without having to worry about it breaking on them every time they wear it.
