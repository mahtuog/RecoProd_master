This is my second Bluetooth Headset; I had a Motorola HS820 before. It turns out they have complementary problems:The Motorola sounded good but wouldn't stay on my ear. It feel off once too often and stopped working after less than a year.This Plantronics 330 sticks to my ear like gravy. But the call quality is indifferent-to-bad.Using it with a Cingular 2125 it is hard for people to understand me; "Quiet" and "echoey" are the two most common complaints. I can understand them quite well but only provided that I hold the phone within 3 feet of the receiver. The range is appalling.I used to wear my Motorola headset and wander around the room with no impact on signal quality; with the Plantronics 330 if I wear the headset on my right ear and put the phone in my left jacket pocket it causes the quality to deteriorate sharply. If I've been on a call for 20 or 30 minutes, I have to hold the phone within inches of the headset to maintain a tolerable signal.I do find it very comfortable and stable. It has a little rubber bud that one inserts inside one's ear and it never falls off, but based on its limitations I would not recommend this device.
