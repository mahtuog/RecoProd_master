Like many of you I thought this was going to be the answer to my dreams of a wireless headset. Wrong! This is made from the cheapest plastic known to mankind. My girlfriend got them for me this Christmas, and I was elated. Two weeks later cracks started to appear on the headband adjustment casing. Pow! The right side broke! So I epoxied it together. No worries! Incorrectomundo! Cracks along the left started to appear! Everybody together now! POW! The left! Epoxy to the rescue! It should be fine now.......................right!!!!! WRONG! Today the bracket which allows the earphones to swing upward broke like a pinata at a birthday party. I wish I could say I was BASE jumping or fighting ninjas when this happened, but sadly I was watching a movie trying not to disturb my lady, when the final fracture occured! The torrent of profanities pouring out of me was the opposite of what these headsets were supposed to accomplish!To conclude! Cheap plastic, Badly designed, Break easily, Will not survive ninja battle! Please Plantronics try harder next time.
