When I first got this phone I was very excited about it, but now I am ready to bail out from T-Mobile and get a different phone and plan.1) The coverage is lousy. As soon as you leave a metro area, you lose coverage. There seems to be no roaming option with T-Mobile, unlike other phone companies.2) The phone is an interesting toy, but the camera is unwieldy and doesn't work very well. The pictures are dim, blurry, and the screen has poor resolution. Altogether a disappointing experience.
