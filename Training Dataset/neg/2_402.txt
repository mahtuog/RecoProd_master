I'm in Sunnyvale, CA; where this phone (T-Mobile) has zero reception and my Sprint PCS phone has 3 of 5 bars when in the same location side-by-side. the keys are extremely difficult to use. the calendar/organizer feature is useless; the camera is a disgrace. I returned mine. I hope you avoid the hassle.
