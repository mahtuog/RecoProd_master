I bought this model because of the in-ear bud. I had tried others that just sat on top of the ear. The on-ear never felt comfortable or locked-in.This model is adequate, but nothing special. Regardless how far I am away from the phone or laptop, I hear steady static. I've paired it to my phone (Palm Treo 650), my laptop (Dell Latitude D620) and my fiance's phone (Samsung SGH-D807). All are about the same in terms of the static. Listening to music from the laptop is really bad and low quality, but that's not the main usage model for this device. As a cellphone headset, it's just OK.My fiance has the Plantronics Discovery 655. That's a much better device and well worth the extra money.
