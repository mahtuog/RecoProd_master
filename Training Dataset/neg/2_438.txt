I just got this phone and the talking quality is good only when you are out of the door. It's bad to use it in a building. The technical data is also misleading. I had expected this phone to stand for about 10 days (no need to say 12 days) but it stands only 2 days and I have to recharge it. I charged my previous 3390 once per week for my usage.I got cheated again by Sony for their &quot;technical data&quot;.
