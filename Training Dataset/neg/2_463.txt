I bought this phone in march. The thing is this phone has nice features but either t mobile service is bad or the phone sensors are weak as reception is bad. I called up T mobile several times and they said that they will take a look at the reception and put new towers if required. They did not live to their word as expected. I am thinking to file a lawsuit against t mobile to have such a bad reception and not living up to their word. The thing is the phone works well when i am outdoors but does not work well in indoors. So try other phones. I know ATT phone works well in my house since I had one before.
