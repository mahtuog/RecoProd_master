I used this phone for three weeks now , I am not very happyabout it.Pros:1. A lot of features. (BLUETooth, IRDA and so on.)2. Cheap( got it for $50 before rebate.)Cons:1. Very difficult to take SIM card out.2. The key pad is badly designed, sometimes the keys stuck under the face plate and cause the pone to froze.3. Menu is difficult to use .4. standby time is about 1/3 ( or less) what Sony Ericsson stated. Other phones I used before usually get 60%-70% of stand by time with light usage.5. Ring volumn is low. Vibrating(Ring) is not strong enough.6. The phone screen get dirty easily.7. Only 1 mb of memory avaliable (T-mobile).The reciption signal is ok for this phone. This phone looks cool , but the quality is poor. Spend a little more for a better phone. I will not recommand this phone.
