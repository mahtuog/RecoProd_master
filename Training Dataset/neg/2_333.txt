I love the concept: one device for car or hotel room. I used the travel charger regularly for seven-months. The product worked fine with the exception that it does not sync as advertised.Without warning the charger would not fit easily into the entry port. When I attempted to reseat the charger, it apparently shorted the system, and erased all my data. Most frustrating, requiring several wasted hours with the techies at Verizon.Just ordered a Palm car charger as a replacement. Now I need to lug two separate charger for travel.
