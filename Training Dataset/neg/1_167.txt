I ordered this product and received it within the specified amount of time. However, When I opened the package the item I received was NOT the one that I ordered. It was a completely different item then I ordered.It wasn't even similar. The bluetooth I received was black and silver. I was very disappointed.Needles to say I was going to keep it after to calling the number on my shipping paper. I opened the package and the bluetooth DID NOT even work!!!!!!!!!! I returned the item and received my money back but I still spent money to send the item back and never got a shipping label from the company when I asked for one. Very displeased.
