When the phone came it didn't recognize the SIM card. I called t-mobile, one woman told me the SIM card was locked and that they need to file a form to request the unlock code. I needed to wait for 24 hours to get it. She didn't know why it was locked!The next day I received an email saying that I am not eligible to have the unlock code yet because any account should be activated 90 days before they can have an unlocked code! How rediculous this sounds! I called them again, a man told me he had to file another form, basically just another request for the unlock code and a waive for the 90 day period. I needed to wait for another 24 hours. I asked if I can go to a local store and have it checked, he told me NO!The day after that I received another email, which was exactly the same as what I've got the last time! Not a sigle word was different. I called them the third time, a woman finally said &quot;sorry&quot; to me, and said I can go to a local store and have a new SIM card.Finally the phone worked after I got to the local store. Then a week after I used it, the phone died out of nothing. It was sitting on the table when I picked it up and found it was not responding to anything. I called t-mobile again, a guy didn't say sorry or anything, he said they will mail me another one within 5 days. He was about to say good-bye before I asked him &quot;so I have no phone to use before I get the new&quot;, he said oh, you can go to a local store and have a loan phone or something. The guy sounded like a dead person talking I was so sick of listening to him.Well, now I am waiting. I hope you good luck on this phone and T mobile. They all made me so sick.
