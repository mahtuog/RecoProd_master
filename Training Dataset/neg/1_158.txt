I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died. Actually, I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it. I was impressed with the advertised battery life, and took the plunge. Shouldn't have. While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle. You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight. Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it? And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it. So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line. On the plus side, the sound is nice and loud in th speaker. That's about it. Try something else, like a bluetrek or motorola or something. I am trying the Motorola next. This thing is trash.
