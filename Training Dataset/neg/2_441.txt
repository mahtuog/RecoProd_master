...I wouldn't have bought this phone. I get horrible reception pretty much everywhere go when others with the same carrier but different phones do just fine. The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today. I consistently &quot;call&quot; people from my pocket if I neglect to turn the key lock on. Next time I'll get a flip phone with a decent antenna...
