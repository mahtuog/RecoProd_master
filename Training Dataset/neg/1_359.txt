Cell phone easily gets pushed up and disconnected from holder when worn on the belt and you sit in certain chairs. Lost my phone just this way and because of this product. Luckily found it later. Nice idea, but it needs improvement in design and those of us who purchased one of these should be provided with a re-designed product.
