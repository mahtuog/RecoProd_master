This is the worst phone I have ever had. The speaker is terrible. You have to shove it into your ear to hear anything, even after you have turned the volume all the way up. After having it for 3 MONTHS, the screen went blank and I couldn't see anything. Luckily, Cingular sent me a new one. However, the battery would only last for about two days with the new one, and I had to buy a new battery. The buttons on the side are a pain because they will get pushed inside your pocket and make the phone beep and go out of silent mode. Very annoying. So, like I said, DON'T BUY IT!!!
