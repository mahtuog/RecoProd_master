This clip is definitely useful, but it could be made better considering how much it costs. The flat metal spring that held the clip closed over my belt slowly deformed over a couple months, so the clip didn't close any more and the whole thing just fell off my belt. I found cheaper ones at my local electronics superstore that didn't do that (but broke other ways). If you want a belt clip, this will work, but you have to face it...this isn't the last one you'll buy.
