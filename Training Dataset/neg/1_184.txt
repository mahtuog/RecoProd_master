It's probably not Amazon's fault... It's the cell phone industry trying to flood the market with stuff that becomes obsolete quickly. Just think of all the different phone chargers you've had to buy over the years. Standardization would be nice for the consumer.The phone I needed a face plate for is several years old. The original picture of the face plate I ordered was exactly what I wanted, but the one I received was a "newer" version.The good news is that Amazon took the product back and returned the money to my credit card.
