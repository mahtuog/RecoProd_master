I bought this on a gold box special for $17.99. And that's BARELY what it is worth. It is not like the wonderful description. I can't put my phone in my pocket or it doesn't work, constantly breaking up and muffled. The phone has to be fairly close(a foot or so) to the bluetooth or the voice breaks up. I am totally disappointed with it. I had previously owned two motorola bluetooth devices, and they were far superior to this. I lost the last one in a house fire and was trying to replace it. Poor choice. It is much larger and not as comfortable and stable as the old one. The regular price on this is about the same as I paid for the other(the motorola), and the quality is far below. I was going to return it, but there is no return choice that lists poor quality as a reason.
