Only let AT & T give you this phone if:--you would rather not be bothered by irritating calls unless your phone is 100% charged--you prefer to charge your phone every single day--you prefer to receive messages and texts several hours after they are sent--you like having really small buttons, making texting difficult--you would rather not have information from voice mails available on screen--you have to actually listen to the voice mail just to find out who called!!!That's right, this is the cell phone that while fully charged sometimes sends calls right to voice mail while turned on, then informs you of a missed call hours later; this issue increases in frequency when not 100% charged. I have had two of them and am battling AT & T to get something else. The worst thing is that, despite its obvious flaws, if you are a light user you don't realize the missed calls thing until you've had it for a while.Additional problems: changing the volume on the speaker is a challenge--you can only do it while a call is in session and it is a very small button on the side of the phone--no setting on disk; you cannot see incoming caller id without opening the phone; the battery life is pathetically short; and the camera is utterly, totally worthless.This phone would have been a stellar performer in, say, 1985. Now it just sucks. Contrary to another reviewer's opinion about it "not" being "terrible overall," I think that yes, it is indeed terrible, overall and every other possible way.
