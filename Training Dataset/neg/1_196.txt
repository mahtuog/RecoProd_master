Warning, Plantronics Plusar 590a headsets are not mp3 cell phone player compatible.My phone is an LG8100 and others are said to be affected. Even though the advertising states they are an "Ultimate Stereo Bluetooth Headset" and as personally stated by an online rep. "Absolutely compatible with the LG8100 cell phone", they will not work as such with my phone. Unfortunately I purchased these headphones as a solution for allowing good mp3 tunes "in stereo" while puttering around my office while at the same time being able to switch to the phone as they quote "seamlessly". Not! They will not access the mp3 player on the phone. Their support personnel wrote me this cop out note when, after purchasing, I inquired why they wouldn't work as their advertising states. "Your phone needs to support the "A2DP" profile (advanced audio distribution) in order to enable full stereo sound and streaming audio with the Pulsar headset. Most currently available phones do not yet support this profile and thus can only make sue of the headset as a mono device for phone calling, not as a media headset for music and other audio outputs." Sorry to sound so negative but to me this was a real bummer and a waste of money. It's kind of stupid running around the office wearing a full stereo headphone set just to answer mono phone calls. Be wary,Mark
