These were way to big for my ears. Even the small size was to large. I usually wear the medium size ear gel that comes with the BT device. I am using these on a Jabra Extreme 2 so maybe they were not made for that device. The gel did fit properly over the device however but I had to force it hard into my hear and it became pretty painful after a couple of hours of wear.
