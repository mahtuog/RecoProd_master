A carrying case should serve two functions: making the phone easier to carry (via clip or whatever attaching device it may have), &amp; protecting the phone from dirt &amp; damage. This carrying case does make the phone easier to carry via its belt clip, but does not protect the phone in any way. The face is open, so dirt or dust can reach the screen &amp; keypad. The case is made of leather so thin that it affords no protection from accidental knocks or drops. A little padding would have gone a long way to make this a better case, &amp; so would a front panel that opens &amp; closes via snap or zip. Also, the case fits way too snugly, &amp; it's a real struggle trying to get the phone into &amp; out of it. I'm now looking for a better made case which offers more protection for my phone. Don't waste your money on this case.
