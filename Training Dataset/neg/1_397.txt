I've been a T-Mobile customer for many years, but am very disappointed with my current phone-- the Motorola T720i (now called the T722i). My first complaint arose on my first call. The earpiece volume is very low even at maximum volume and some calls just have to be ended if they're being made in an environment with any background noise. Many other complaints followed. Most dealt with hardware quality. My 1st one had a flaw in the flip mechanism that caused the phone to think it was being flipped shut when it wasn't-- ending calls unexpectedly. The 1st and 2nd ones would routinely &quot;freeze up&quot; during calls. The signal strength meter indicated full strength and the call timer was still counting, but the person on the other end couldn't hear me anymore and was soon disconnected. This daily occurrence required me to contact T-Mobile and get a 3rd one of these phones, which I'm sorry to say still has the strange &quot;freeze&quot; problem. All 3 have had the maddeningly low volume as well. Resolution and variable light functionality on the camera attachment are horrible as well, as is the color-quality on the display in general. It just looks washed-out, almost black &amp; white at times despite adjustments. The good news is that Customer Service is great at T-Mobile and they always replace the phone when I have problems. Avoid this phone, however. I'm going back to Nokia.
