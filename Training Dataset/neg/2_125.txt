this case is really tight ( for my pearl 8100) and bulky. I switched back to the original case i got with the phone. The material on the sides (rough PE) is abrasive enough that it leaves fine lines on the phone when you pull the phone in and out of this case. Don't be too dazzled by the leather on the front and back like the other users.
