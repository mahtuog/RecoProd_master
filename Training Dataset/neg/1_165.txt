YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. THIS CHARGER WOULD BARELY PLUG INTO MY CAR OUTLET AND IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO KEEP IT TURNED ON WHILE IN THE CAR. ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENT AND IT THE LITTLE RED LIGHT WOULD TURN OFF.IT WOULD NOT EVEN PLUG INTO MY PHONE. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I ENDED UP THROWING IT WAY AFTER ABOUT 5 DAYS OF TRYING AND TRYING AND TRYING....
