(...)The good: its a very nice looking phone; its the right size, neither too small or too big; blue tooth enabled. The best is the blue tooth that allows you to use wireless headsets or connect to your PC and use the phone to send/receive faxes, surf the net, or update the address book.The bad: you cannot read the screen outside unless its dark (Its like trying to watch TV when the sun is hitting the screen directly.); the camera is a gimmick that fades away pretty quick (I never used it that much); the software is slow; and the menus are counter-intuitive.The worst is the software and the menus. I havent seen a phone that has easier menus than Nokia and this Sony Ericsson is no exception. Nokia's menus are very intuitive and easy to use, this phone's menu is just badly designed, meaning that you have to push more buttons than necessary to perform common tasks like adding a number to your address book, or editing an address book entry, moving messages around, going back to the main menu, etc. Also, because the menus are software-based (vs. being hard wired into the chip like phones with monochrome screens) there is a lag sometimes between the instant you push a button and when the menu is displayed on the screen, like using a computer with little memory. Also, you are not allowed to erase the built-in TMobile graphics and sounds, which take up memory space, and you cannot use a recording as your Ring Tone (they do that so that you dont use "protected" music for your ring tones and are thus forced to buy it from them). Finally, the phone actually crashes if you stop a voice record command immediately after starting it.All in all, nice looking hardware but with crappily designed menus.
