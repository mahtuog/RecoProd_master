The Good:Great PriceStylishProtects the phone when you drop (and boy have I)Easy access to phoneThe Bad:Does not stay on my belt! For an active person (I am in the IT department of my company) this case comes off way to easily. The way it secures is not by having your belt run through the clip by merely sliding it over your belt. This is ok for people who tend not to be on the move. But as I drive a lot, as well as move/lift/climb over/crawl under many things, this clip comes off way to easily.Does not allow chargin of the phone while in its holster. (Yeah I know it takes a second to pop it out, but I am always on the go)Summary:For an active user this is 2 stars, for a non active user this is a 4 star device.
