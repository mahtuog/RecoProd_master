I'm giving it 1-star for the service from Amazon concerning this item. I ordered one on Sunday Aug. 21 and was told it would ship on the 23rd or 24th (it's advertised as "Usually ships in 2 to 3 business days.) By the end of business on the 24th I called and was told they didn't have the phone and the new estimated ship date was now Aug. 29. On the 29th, I called in the morning and was told they had the phone and it was scheduled to ship out. In the afternoon I called again and was told it showed to be on backorder and they had no idea when it would ship. That's when I cancelled the order. Watch out, for it still says "Usually ships in 2 to 3 business days."
