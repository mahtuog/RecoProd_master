I &quot;had&quot; a Nakia phone with this case, but I found out the hard way it will slip off your belt. I lost my phone while riding my motorcycle, never did find it. I plan on buying another Nokia phone but will look for a case that can't slip off so easily or will have to be sure I take it off before I ride. Also, I did have this phone and case slip off in the car also.
