I just got this phone last week from Cingular. I got it for $29.99 which I thought was a good price. I don't care much for Cingular. I am an old AT&T customer. I don't always get my messages on it. I have tried to register it with AOL mobile and I still have not gotten my confrim message yet. I don't like the side buttons I am always hitting them. Otherwise I like it so far.
