in general, I like this phone, although the buttons are a little too small and awkward to press.however, the camera is absolutely terrible. you have to have really bright lighting to get anything to come out. and i'm not talking just bright, mid day light. i'm talking indoor, flourescent office lighting. outdoor shots look terrible. the worst part is the color. its washed out and everything has a murky brown quality. i took a photo of a white piece of paper and it came out brownish yellow. if you want a TMobile camera phone, wait for the samsung 205. its bound to be better.
