when i first received this case i was impressed with how clear it was and how sleek. it did not take any beauty away from the phone itself. however, the clip is way too big and bulky - an inch thick and does not hold well at all. for being so big, one would think it would have to be strong as well, but that is not the case with this clip. the second day i had the case, it cracked in the center where the thin piece of plastic is located between the screen and trackball - and this happened from me putting my pearl in my center console on its side. then, a couple of days later it cracked again and then the middle piece broke off alltogether. the case protected the phone, since the phone did not get damaged or scratched, but the case itself needs a protector to keep it intact. so, the one star is for the good looking nature of this case but not the protection or lack thereof.
