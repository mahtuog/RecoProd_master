I've had the T610 for almost a year and it has low reception quality compared to other phones of the same service provider and had enormous problems with static during calls. If it weren't for these two problems, the phone is mediocre at best. The features of the phone are great: Bluetooth, infrared,and sync. However, the relability of the phone during calls is poor.
