I was incredibly disappointed when I got a message a few days after I made and paid for my order that said "we don't have this item in stock. It could take up to two weeks. If after two weeks we don't ship your order, then may can opt to cancel it." Those aren't the exact words, but it was something to that effect. Also, I had already paid for priority shipping, which I did not receive and did not get reimbursed for. This was one of the three items on my ticket. The other items were not important and shipped fairly fast. The BlackBerry battery that I ordered on a priority basis, was critically important, and didn't arrive for about two weeks. While Amazon has been good to me over the years, this was a frustrating and disappointing experience.
