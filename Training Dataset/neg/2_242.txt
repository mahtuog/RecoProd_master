I bought it from Amazon shiping to me fast. But next day I call Amazon to return it with the reason the manual book written in Spanish which I can't read or undwerstand and it look very cheap quality.Many customers like me complaint Amazone not reveal in small detail or correct something written on the goods( like Motorola V8 orV9.It is high end cell and expensive, the customers want to know what content it had in box?where it made from? The other sellers online Ebay, Bestbuy said very detail in box)
