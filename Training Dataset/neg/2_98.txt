I was really looking forward to the Bluetooth Wireless experience; however, the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not all that great. With regular usage for three months with my Sony Ericsson T637, I found: a very short battery life, mediocre reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 7 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive static in the background and that it was hard to hear me.This technology could be great, but its a little overrated right now with the cell phone accessories that are currently available. I have had good luck with previous Jabra products and this one, the FreeSpeak, is just disappointing. Maybe I will try this again in a few years. For now, it's back to the "wired" headset.
