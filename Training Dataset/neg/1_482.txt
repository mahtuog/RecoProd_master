I received this phone 10 days ago and I'm still trying to activate it...The phone looks cool, but what's not cool is the service at Cingular. Cingular claims that porting a phone number from another company usually takes that long!! The long waiting time, even when you want to talk to a manager, is more than 15 minutes..I have decided to go back to T-Mobile... They're more experienced and friendly....I don't want this phone because of Cingluar...
