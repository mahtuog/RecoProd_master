It sounds good and people hear me well so far. The part that goes in your ear comes off easily and is lost easily. The charge is easily lost the charging process is not good. As I said before the car charger is any good because the adapter that goes with isnt with the product. This bluetooth doesnt allow for listening to music either. It fell out of my ear in to the sink and worked after get wet so that is a good thing.
