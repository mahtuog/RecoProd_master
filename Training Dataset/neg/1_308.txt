I purchased two of these in June '01, and BOTH were dead as a doornail by Sept '01. I use an Ericsson charger that doesn't allow overcharging and I conditioned the battery each month - which means that they were dead after the 3nd conditioning. Neither would charge back up after they had been discharged. In fairness to Ericsson, I have to say that their warranty service is SUPERLATIVE. They sent me upgrade replacement batteries, no shipping charges, within one week. Ericsson gets five stars but this particular battery gets one.
