Although this phone is nice and small I regret ever switching to it. Verizon puts the worst operating systems on their phones. I like to leave my phone on vibrate and keep it in my pocket. But this phone never stops vibrating. When a scroll down a menu, or when a miss a call or when the battery is low it just vibrates over and over. Its driving me mad!
