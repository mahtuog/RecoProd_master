After reading some of the reviews, I'm on day 10 of the 15 day trial period, after sending my excellent E815 in for repair. I needed a phone ASAP. I can assur eyou all this phone is going back!I've always liked the look and coolness of the Razr, and figured it wasn't much different then the E815.Boy was I wrong!This phone isn't even in the same class! The E815 blows it away. But thanks Verizon, what do you do with peobably the best Motorola cell phone to date? Why of course, we cancel it!Of all fo the negatives your hearing here on Amazon--more specifically about the phone itself, I completely concur. Battery lif eon the phone seems like you'll get four to five calls max and then it's ready for a charge. What's worse is that I can't charge it and have an ear piece in at the same time. I know, I know, some of you are going to scream, "Well why dont' you go out and get a Bluetooth?" Well after losing my 4th Bluetooth in under 8 months, I've decided that experiment is now over. These things are just too easy to lose if you don't have it on your ear 365/24/7.I for one have no need what-so-ever for V Cast, Verison's hideous music purchasing site, I want to be able to change my icons on the damn phone I just got done spending $300.00 because I'm only 9 months into my current plan. Verizon doest not allow this!So moral of the story is, while the phone is great looking, it's just really not all that good of a phone. It's nothing but trouble from every aspect.Good luck for those of you that do buy it!
