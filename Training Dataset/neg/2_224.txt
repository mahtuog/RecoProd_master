This is the absolute worst cellphone i have ever owned! i think that this phone is poorly made. Every friend that I have that owns this phone all have the same problems. After less than a month the screen started blanking out and the &quot;flip&quot; has &quot;flopped&quot;! Not to mention the camera SUCKS! I thought that I just got a bad model and I planned to return it, until I was told by more than a few friends that they all had similar problems. I'm switching to the Nokia 3650. Let's see how that goes...
