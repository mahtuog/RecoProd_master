Do not waste your time or money on this one. This is a great idea, but unfortunately the production quality was subpar. The unit works via bluetooth with the iPhone and the connection is incredibly unreliable. When I bought the unit a few weeks ago, there were very few customer reviews listed for the keyboard. Now that I have it, there are a number of reviews indicating that it suffers from bluetooth connectivity issues. I have packaged it up and returned it to the seller (unfortunately a third party on Amazon) and am hoping that a refund is provided/
