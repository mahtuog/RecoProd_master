The Nokia 6126 has some very nice features (most of which are also found on newer phones). My gripe is that this phone is incompatible with every PC-to-Phone software program available. The only program which is available is the "Nokia PC Suite" (free at Nokia web site). But that program can't do near what most other Cell-to-PC programs can do.The Nokia Suite for this Phone cannot dedect the contents of the Sim Card, nor the Sim itself. Hence, many features are inaccessible.(Only Phone memory and the add on Miro-chip memory is available.)The contact list editor is the worst ever I've seen. The Contact List should be the core on any phone. If you want to play mp3's - get an mp3 player. The sound quality is severely lacking, and no bass at all.If you want a camera - get a digital camera because clarity will be a world of difference. That leaves us with a Contact List Editor.(1) Cumbersome pop up windows for entries, rather than as all other programs do, which can be edited on one single page and can be printed out. The Nokia 6126 does not have printing, neither does the Nokia 6125 PC Suite. (It will allow you to print 1 Contact per page -- good luck printing 40 pages which would normally fit on 1 page.)There are plenty of sites that only discuss the good points, and I agree it's a nice phone if the core reason for having a phone, contacts and appointment calendar editing & printing wouldn't be so cumbersome or simply unavailable.My last beef is battery life. For my purposes, standby gives me relative sufficient time, but use the phone with PC sync, one better hurry.Charging time runs between 2 1/2 to 3 hours on a home 110V charger.
