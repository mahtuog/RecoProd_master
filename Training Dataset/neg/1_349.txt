This phone/pda has real problems. I too am waiting for Joe Schmoe's phone to be refurbished by Cingular and sent to me. I am just hoping that I am within the warrantee -- something that Cingular cannot confirm, although I have had the various phones almost a year -- or just over a year. You are asking for it if you buy this device!
