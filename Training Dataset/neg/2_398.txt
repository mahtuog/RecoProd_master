I've had my phone for just about a year. When I initally bought it, I was excited at having a smaller phone, but realized this comes at a price. Let's just say it's the perfect size for the 18 month old I nanny. Everything on the phone is compact so if you are over 5 feet tall, you may find you need to adjust the phone when you are speaking and listening. The buttons are rather small and difficult to manuever if you don't have small fingers. The sound quality is so-so. It is lightweight (this is a plus). If you are looking to take pictures with the phone, the quality is grainy (typical of the first camera phones). After this phone, I've decided to go back to a flip phone because unless you remember to lock the keys you may find your phone dialing your contacts while it's in your purse or bag. After my year with my T610 phone, I'm looking forward to trading it in.
