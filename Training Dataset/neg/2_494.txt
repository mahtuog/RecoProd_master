Bought this several months ago from a local store and I am disappointed. I have used several bluetooth headsets in the past few years that I have either lost or broke including:Logitech Mobile Freedom (Ear loop broke, not replaceable)Jawbone (Speaker part broke from the headset)Motorola H300 (Lost)Out of all the headsets I have owned, this one has the weakest bluetooth connection. I typically keep my phone in my shirt or pants pocket and with the other headsets I have used this is not a problem. With this headset the signal cuts in and out and it is difficult to have a conversation.I am looking for a new headset and based on my prior experience it needs:Excellent range and quality for the bluetooth connectionLong battery lifeDurable and replaceable partsLike to have a user replaceable battery
