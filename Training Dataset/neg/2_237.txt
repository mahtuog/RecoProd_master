The little black tip on the end of the charger snapped off inside my 8260 leaving it unable to be charged with either the car charger or the wall charger. The ATT store couldn't extract the piece and told me this was common for this charger and phone after 1 1/2 yrs. More of a hassle than I'd expect. Sure, it worked fast but I'm bothered by what seems planned obsolescence by the manufacturers at Nokia. I don't like having to get a new phone or accessories every couple of years. Thumbs down on the durability.
