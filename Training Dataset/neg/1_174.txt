This phone deserves zero rating. Or minus 1. It's that bad. It just turned itself off for no reason, while I was on a very important call with someone whose number I don't have. Battery is half full, but it decided to take a break a guess. I turned it on, and it works fine now.Other problems:- Buttons don't click any more even though they do seem to work; but those that don't "click" any more need tons of pressure to work.- Navigation through menus is cumbersome for some simple things like sending a text message.- Sound is bad as is both reception and transmission. This in a good coverage area. The biggest problem is it cuts off for no reason.- Camera is like a trip back to the earliest digital cameras of early 90s. Picture quality is so bad, you'll wish you never even tried taking those pictures.- I never even use this phone for anything else other then phone calls. I don't really care about the camera, mp3 and so on, so I am dissapointed that even simple things like staying on when battery is full, is a challenge.- Battery life is bad.- Battery indicator is worse. You may leave home with battery half full only to find out that it's getting empty within minutes. And - yes - I do charge my phone fully, and use it until the battery is (almost) empty.- Both my wife and I have the same phone. We use it not more then once to twice a day. Very very light use. Yet both of our phones exibit identical problems. Buttons on her phone got bad even faster then mine - within days of purchasing it.All in all I don't remember when was the last time I was so dissapointed with my purchase. This phone feels like some bootleg black market import, not a real Nokia. However I bought it from AT&T; so it's real.
