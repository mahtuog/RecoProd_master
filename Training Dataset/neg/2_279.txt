I'll admit, this is a tough phone to design a case for, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. That said, I can't count the number of times my phone has dropped to the floor because the snap on the antenna strap has come undone. Since the mount for the belt clip is attached below the phone's center of gravity, It constantly rotates upside down which contributes to this problem. Add the fact that it really doesn't protect the phone to start with and you are better off keeping your phone in your pocket with your keys and change. That way, you'll at least always know where it is!
