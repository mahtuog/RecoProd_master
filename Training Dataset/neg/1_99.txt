it gets horrible reception except in the most covered area. i live less than a mile from a major shopping center with a tower and i get no reception standing in my front yard. i have to call three or four times before my call goes through because i get "network busy" or "call ended" signals incessantly. ive had it for less than 6 months and the screen is very loose at the hinge. the buttons lose their spring action quickly and several of the buttons backlighting have already begun to fade.poor signalpoor designpoor qualityminimum of featuresand it cost me $180 without signing up for another two years on my contract.
