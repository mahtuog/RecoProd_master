I've had my pair for four months now they look great and the sound isn't bad overall. But that's where it ends. My pair died and would not recharge and the hinges developed cracks since it has plastic hinges with steel pins holding them together. My friends pair also has cracks in his hinges and i am talking about 2 to 3 cracks. I sent them in and they told me that I should not keep them on the stand when not in use, Isn't that what the stand is for????
