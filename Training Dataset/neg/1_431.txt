This item has few redeeming features, and lots of problems. First, it is extremely cheaply constructed with very thin plastic. It probably would not survive a fall from a table onto a hard floor. Second, you can't really use it as a spare charger, since it does not come with its own cord. You have to use the one that came with your phone or fork out the extra bucks for a spare cord. Third, the battery is held in place by a flimsy spring mechanism. It's hard to get the battery seated properly, and if you bump the charger even slightly, it dislodges from the electrical contacts. Fourth, it was apparently only designed to charge standard-size batteries. It does not accomodate the auxilliary-size Motorola batteries. Fifth, the documentation is almost non-existent. For the cost, I expected something with better construction and design. Dont' buy this one; here are higher quality 3rd party chargers out there that are cheaper.
