TERRIBLE PHONE, REPLACED BATTERY TWICE AND IT STILL HAS TO BE CHARGED DAILY WITH MINIMUM USE. CALLED MOTOROLA FOR HELP. CANT HELP YOU, GO BACK TO THE SELLER. NEW BATTERY DIDNT HELP. SO I HAVE TO KEEP A CHARGER WITH ME ALL THE TIME.CANT RECEIVE OR CALL FROM MY OFFICE ( IN A BUILDING) WHILE OTHER PHONES WORK, LIKE NOKIA OR BLACKJACK.
