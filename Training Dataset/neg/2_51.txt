I have been a longtime Nokia supporter, and love that they sell simple, easy-to-navigate phones that pick up great reception. However, I returned this phone after one day of use because:- the sound quality was not good: static was present in the background of all of my calls.- when I put the phone near any speaker, the phone caused the speakers to make very disruptive bleeping noises. This included my car stereo and my speakerphone at work.
