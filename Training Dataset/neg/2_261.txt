I ordered this particular headset because of the three sizes of earpieces. My ears are smallish and I was excited to think Jabra had solved my problem. On the contrary. The smallest earpiece is still uncomfortably large for my ear.Then there's the background buzz. I don't really care to spend my cell minutes listening to my friends complain about sound quality! I'll be trying something else.
