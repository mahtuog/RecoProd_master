I bought the Jabra Earset for my Nokia 5190 about a month ago. A friend of mine also bought the same earset and I was able to hear them talking on theirs (using Nokia 6190). The receiver sound quality (talking) is slightly worse than a normal cellphone. It sounds somewhat distant and echoey. Also, it picks up background noise, especially from a car and almost seems to amplify the noise, making it hard for people to hear you. The speaker (listening) for the user is very clear and I had no problems finding an earpiece adapter that fit me.PROBLEM: The biggest problem I've noted with these earsets is an annoying background &quot;buzz&quot;. I have been told that this is caused by the earpiece wire picking up reception from the cellphone antenna. This buzz can be heard both on your side and the person you are talking to can hear it as well, creating quite an annoyance. In fact, this background buzz is so bad at times that I have stopped using my Jabra earset entirely unless I am driving (It is law in California). The only way to get rid of the buzz is to orient the wire in certain positions or hold the wire in certain places (very impractical, especially if you are moving around). I would return this item and buy something else except that I bought it using an Amazon discount certificate, so I can't. I've been told that not all earsets have this problem so it is probably advisable that you if you get this you are able to return it or try it out first.
