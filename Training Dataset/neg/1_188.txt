I purchased my first headset in Dec 05, after one week of use the unit would not charge, but Plantronics was good enough to send me another one seeing how it was still under warranty! Received the replacement unit mid Jan 06, as of yesterday the unit started having the same problem as the first one; i'm no longer able to charge it. I expected a better design/quality product from Plantronics! I'm now waiting on yet another replacement unit!
