This is the basic "attach to your belt" case for a palm treo shaped device.One complaint is that it can come off your belt fairly easily. My palm has not yet broken when this happens, nor has it dropped into water or snow. But the potential is there. So you need to be careful when wearing it.The second complaint is that the case provides no protection for your stylus. My stylus has fell from the palm several times now. So far it fell in my home or office, where I later located it. But eventually it will fall while "out in the world" and that will be it.For the price paid, not bad. But it's nothing special.
