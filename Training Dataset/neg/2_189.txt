Think twice before you buy this. My first and second Treo 600s had identical problems, where they couldn't find the network for some reason, and the answer button wouldn't work. I got the first one in February 05, and the 1st replacement in April 05. The second replacement came a week later. Now, this one has developed these orange pixels [http://discuss.treocentral.com/archive/index.php/t-51494.html], and Sprint is going to replace this one. I will note that Sprint has only replaced my phone with refurbished phones, so I can just imagine that I'm just waiting on my replacement phone, which is just Joe Schmoe's broken phone that has the same darn problems. I just hope that all of these problems keep happening within the warranty period. If you can, buy the warranty.
