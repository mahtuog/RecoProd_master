I found this to be a good holster though the pictures made it seem thinner than it actualy was. The clip broke off of the holster that I got my girlfriend for her phone, and I first assumed that it was because of rough use. About a mounth later the clip broke off in the same place on mine when the seatbelt in my car pulled on it. This is probibly somthing that could be fixed by the manufacturor, the plastic seems week in that spot, and I'd recommended getting one of the other availible cases for this phone.
