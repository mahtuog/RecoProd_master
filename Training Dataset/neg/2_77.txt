A few other reviewers tried to warn me the same way but I went for it anyway. Contrary to the listing as a NEW battery, this was a used battery that performed the same as the 2 year old battery that came with my Blackberry 8830 World Edition. After 2 years, it holds a charge for about 1 day.Save your money and the hassles. Then go to a chain or big box store and hand over the cash for a (real) new battery.
