CONTINUOUSLY have to pair/sync this with my phone. It will stop typing mid sentence, then I have to turn the keyboard off then back on with the cheap, hard to move switch. This will happen about every 5 or 6 words typically, but can range from way more to way less. Whats way less than 5 words you ask? Pressing one button and have it continually be entered on the screen since the connection was lost, then having to erase the repeated letters that were entered, then the delete key does the same thing erasing possibly your entire message. This happens even right after its been charged, so cant be the battery.Id expect more out of such an expensive product. Having an extra thing to charge every couple of days (NOT 2 WEEKS) is an extra annoyance I'd be willing to put up with if this thing worked. This has driven me to sell my iPhone and buy a smartphone with a keyboard built in (Droid 4). If you need a keyboard, buy a phone that has one already.
