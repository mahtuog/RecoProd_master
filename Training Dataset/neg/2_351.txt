I didnt like it from the moment i put it on. Poor fit, horrible belt buckle with an impossible to find clip. The color was a bit 'loud' for me too.Interestingly enough i ordered a similar case in black from another maker (same style though) and like it much better. It actually stays on my phone and the belt clip is easy to find.
