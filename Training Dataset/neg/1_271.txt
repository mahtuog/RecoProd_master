I don't suggest buying this. I have a Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless) and I wish I hadn't gotten it.Verizon Wireless uses their proprietary software to lock away features that come standard in Motorola RAZRs.* So you can't get ringtones or music onto your phone unless you spend money through their proprietary V-Cast system. That's right, no copying from your PC to your phone.* You can't download pictures to your computer. They suggest e-mailing it to yourself.* You can't upload pictures to your phone unless you (yes, you guessed it) use their service.Lastly - and I've called and checked with their technician on this - there is NO WAY to copy all of your text messages from your phone to your PC. So if you've been texting up a storm and you want to save them, sorry.I've tried buying a USB plug that connects between my RAZR and my PC. I've even purchased two different brands of software at Fry's Electronics that's supposed to enable you to transfer stuff easily between phone and PC. Unfortunately, they won't work because my RAZR is from Verizon Wireless. In fact, there are discussions on Web bulletin boards on hacking into your Verizon phone in order to disable Verizon's software locks - just so you can get features that come standard on the Motorola RAZR.In the end, I feel suckered and duped by Verizon. I'd rather get a product that lets you do all of the above for free.
