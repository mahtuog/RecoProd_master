I bought 2 phones. These phones have lots of good features. UNFORTUNATELY...Their reception is very bad. I also spoke to a friend who has inside info --&#62; most of the returns at that dealer is because of bad reception of these phones..Now, I am waiting to give up my phones after a year. I hope I knew this earlier.
