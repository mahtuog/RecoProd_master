I think Burton is onto something excellent here..... however, it'll probably be another year or two before its technology is perfectedFirst off - the jacket is excellent! Very flexible, warm, and waterproof --- so no complaints on the jacketIt is the technology that disappoints meThe jacket has a neat construction --- you keep your iPod on one side of your chest and your phone on the other side, with a remote on your wrist that pretty much controls both devicesThe phone functions are neat because calls come through immediately, with the speakers in the hoodie allowing you to hear the other person calling and a mic in the front part allowing you to talk ---- the entire setup is pretty convenient and pretty solid, as people could hear me well and I could hear themHowever, the speaker could be better..... calls and music come through clear, but I wish it were much louderThe iPod functions are what really upset me though -- the iPod is slow to respond to the wrist controls functions.... in addition, sometimes the iPod functions won't work if you have the phone connected on bluetoothoverall -- the stability of the jacket's system needs to be worked out --- I'm pretty impressed with it, but wait another year for Burton to fix this onePEACE AND LOVE AND HAPPY BUYING!!!!!!Muhammad Ali Hasan
