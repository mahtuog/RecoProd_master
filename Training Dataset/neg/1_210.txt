This is the 2nd time I have purchased this item - I loved my 1st one. It was a great holster; I only replaced it because the elastic siding was wearing out & making my blackberry slide out much too easily. I dropped it on several occasions because it would slide out of the case. But it took it over 2 years of daily wear to get to that point - so I considered it a really good product & ordered another one. This time the price was about a third of what I had initially paid. Unfortunately - the quality is definitely sub-par. After less than 3 months, the clip feels loose & the inside covering is peeling apart in 2 places and exposing my blackberry to a gummy residue. At the price - it's not worth sending it back. I would have rather paid more & gotten a quality product like I did the first time. I can't help but wonder if this is just a lemon or is it counterfeit?
