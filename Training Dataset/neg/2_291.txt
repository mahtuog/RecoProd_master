Whenever you call 9-1-1 on this phone, it sounds a really loud alarm. This "feature" can not be disabled.If you are calling because someone is breaking into your house, the alarm will announce to the thief where in the house you are hiding.Aside from that the phone is great. But the 9-1-1 alarm is a deal breaker for me.
