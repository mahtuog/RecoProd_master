I recieved this phone as a bonus from Cingular to upgrade to a family plan. This is by far the worst reception on a cell phone that I've had in the 10 or so years I've been using cell phones. I can't use it at all inside my house. Even when I'm driving and I'm getting a strong signal sometimes I can't make out what the other person is saying. I feel like crushing this phone sometimes. I have had people call me 3 or 4 times and I never know about it and than they will get through to me and say that they've been trying to call me and while we are talking it will notify me that I've missed 3 calls. Unbelievable!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!
