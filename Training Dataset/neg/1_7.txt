I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking.
