this phone is more design than functionality. the slim body fits easily in a pocket or purse, and the shape of the phone makes it easy to hold while walking or talking. its a trendy phone. good battery life and quality speaker/microphone make it an easy use.the cons:speakerphone isn't loud enough...but is it ever?navigating through the interface on this phone takes ages. i've gotten all four of the software updates and this problem still isn't fixed.the iTap quick type for text messaging is a little more difficult to learn than the t9 i've used previously on LG.overall, this is a decent phone, especially because verizon promotes it in free offers. i wouldn't pay a dime extra for it.
