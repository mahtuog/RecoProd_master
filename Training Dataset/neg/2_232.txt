yeah, go with a different phone. this one has been discontinued because it has so many promlems. I've had it for the past 8 months or so and I'm getting ready to trade it in for a new one for the third time.problems the phone often encounters:-end button stops working-randomly dropped calls-answer the phone to both the microphone AND speaker not working-screen not working so you can't tell who's calling-dirt gets under the screen very easilyI'm sure there are more. it's not all bad, but you're much better off with another phone.
