External display failed within one month. Moisture sensor dot showed red, so Verizon would not honor warranty. Verizon employees smugly said that it must have gotten water spilled on it. This phone had never had water on it, but I had taken it skiing a couple of times, but kept it securely tucked in my zipped sweater pocket, inside my waterproof/breathable jacket. Also took it to an indoor pool facility to watch a swim meet once. I understand others have had similar humidity problems too, especially with the Motorola phones. Stay away unless you live in the desert.
