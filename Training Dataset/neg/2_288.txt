I ordered the boxwave screen protector for my Motorola Q. When I opened it to put it on, there were 2 problems.One corner of the film was folded. Not big enough to stop me from putting it on, but there none the less.The bigger problem was the films (one on each side) covering the screen protector were labeled backwards. I put it on my phone and it did not stick, but all kinds of stuff stuck to the outside. It was ruined.It took weeks of arguing before Boxwave finally gave me my money back. I bought a cheap knockoff for $2. It came in the exact same packaging! But it was labeled correctly! lol.
