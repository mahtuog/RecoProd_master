Well, I've read everyone else's reviews and I must agree that this little phone is really feature-packed. Great color screen, bluetooth, good reception, decent camera, user-friendly enough for me. BUT... The reliability is absolutely HORRIBLE!! I've owned the phone now for 4.5 months and I'm TIRED of all the freezing up!! It is so frustrating! I consider myself to be a very patient person, and if my phone had not locked up PERMANENTLY I would probably still be using it (and tolerating its freezing problems) today. Unfortunately it froze on me a few days ago and no matter what I try -- removing the battery, removing the battery and SIM card, praying, voodoo, etc -- nothing helps. I haven't tried the hard restart since it would wipe out my entire Contacts list. Instead I called T-Mobile and they will be replacing it with a phone &quot;of equal or greater value&quot;. Of course there's no guarantee that the new phone will work with the $80 Jabra FreeSpeak that came (free) with the phone! Get the Nokia 3650 instead -- it's a very nice phone (though kinda big) and is recommended by Leo Laporte (the Tech Guy).
