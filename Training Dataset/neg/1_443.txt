I could hear just fine with this device, but the other partycannot hear you. I fiddled with the little mike (which isattached to the earpiece) but couldn't improve quality. Ileft myself voice mail at home and cell phone to check quality -the words are unintelligible on the message.Also, the little alligator clip that is I guess supposed tokeep the wire from getting tangled broke the first time I used it.The earpiece fit fine and did not give me a problem.
