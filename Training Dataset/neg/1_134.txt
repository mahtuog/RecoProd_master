It was ok for the first month but after, the clips that attach the two pieces together start to break. It is really annoying as you need to take it off to clean the phone and it seems every time I do a piece comes off. You get what you pay for. If you are looking for something that will last for longer than a month I would suggest looking elsewhere.
