I ordered this phone form Cingular (ATT) and today my third defective phone came in the mail. A customer service rep told me that 85% of all her returns and exchanges come from this model phone. The first phone had a handset speaker that didn't work and the next 2 were, in the words of the customer service rep, "DOA" -- dead on arrival. It would be a really nice phone if it worked though...
