I bought the earbuds for my daughter's LG Shine cell phone. Upon arrival I quickly determined they would not work on her phone, but do work on mine. I kept them for myself because I might use them someday and it's not worth returning a 12 dollar item, but I do wish they would have told me they don't work on all LG phones.
