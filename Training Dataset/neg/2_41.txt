Unfortunately I have to buy a new bluetooth headset every couple of months or so because I lose them all the time. This one was no different because I lost it too, a few weeks ago, and replaced it with the Samsung WEP475 Bluetooth Headset which I like much better. Quite honestly, I've had a few Plantronics headsets in my time and I never really cared for any of them.
