Had to return this one. It echos back to the the called party. My hearing isn't the best and I needed to run the volume all the way up. If I held it pushed in hard the echo goes away. The manual says to turn the volume down to eliminate echo. Great, but, then I can't hear. Ordering a model with the mike further away from the speaker.
