My mom and I both tried this phone. My husband tried it in black. All three of us had problems both sending and receiving calls. Half the time it didn't even register that we had missed a call. Other times it took us directly to voicemail without alerting that caller that they were being called. Tried Sony's recommendations--downloading updates via a usb cable sony sent, and a new charger. Tried AT&T's recommendation to "Turn it off while you shower and then turn it back on afterwards so it can receive updates from the tower." Nothing helped. I guess you get what you pay for--this was the free phone offered by AT&T when we set up our plan.
