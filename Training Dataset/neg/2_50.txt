I needed a battery and thought I would try the bigger extended battery. A waste of time and money. The battery worked great but the replacement cover and the 2nd replacement cover did not come close to fitting. I like the phone, but ended up replacing it. I gave it 2 stars because the battery itself, seemd to be OK. Other wise I would be looking for a minus.
