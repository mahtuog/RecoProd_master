I bought two of these at Christmas time. The idea is great and thought they would be good in the cars. The first problem was that none of the tips would fit my Motorola C261 phone. Then I tried it on a Nokia 2600. Although there was a tip that fit perfectly, when I tried to charge the phone the phone screen said STOP and had a little stop sign on it. So I assume the volts were not correct. The flash lite has two setting and worked great. Returned the items as did not work for me.
