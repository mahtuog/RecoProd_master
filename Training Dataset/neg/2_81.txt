I'm gonna be the contrarian amidst the 4- and 5-star reviews. This stand works beautifully in the beginning but over time my Blackberry Curve keeps slipping off. The problem is the fold in the leather that holds the BB up at an angle becomes soft and yield to the weight of the BB and therefore no longer holds it in place. They should have put some kind of stiffener.
