I researched and ordered the Nokia Boom Headset (HDB-5) for the Nokia 2600, which was suppose to work for the Nokia 2600. Upon receiving it I was very disappointed because when I would plug it into my Nokia 2600 it kept coming up with the message 'enhancement not supported'. I tried everything to get it to work (including taking it over to my cell phone store and asking them if I was doing something wrong). They couldn't even come up with an answer. You need to take the Boom Headset (HDB-5) off of the list of enhancements for the Nokia 2600, because it does not work for that model. As you can see it gets a very low rating from me, since it didn't work for my cell phone. Your list of enhancements is very misleading and right now I have no hands off device for my Nokia 2600 because of your misleading list.
