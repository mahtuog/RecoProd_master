The problem with the t610 if you do the research is that it was made for europes networks. While any t-mobile rep will tell you this phone was made just for them (lie). It is an international phone so it works on our network as well however the u.s. version works better here it's the t616 available from at&t/Cingular. I would only recommend getting this phone if you travel to europe often, trust me it works great there!
