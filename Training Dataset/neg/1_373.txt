Well, had 2 headsets in my hands. Plantronics M145 and this bodyglove.Put the bodyglove on, very comfortable, and I could hear the phone ringing loudly in my ear (good). Mom answered, and attempted talking.. After numerous Hellos? I unplugged the headset and told her I was testing a new headset. Plugged it back in, and after much adjusting and shouting realized it wasnt going to work for me. So, I told her to hold on a moment I was going to try it again.Plugged in the M145 and started talking, she asked me if I was going to try the headset again.I guess first things first, avoid the body glove. Second, get the plantronics if you want a good headset
