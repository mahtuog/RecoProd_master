I got this because it matched my phone and the price was right. WELL... the earpiece doesn't come close to fitting properly. I was looking for a nice snug fit that wouldn't fall off at just a shake of my head, and this ain't it! Don't really like the volume control either. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it came in a package that included a matching case with a wrist strap (designed for a Razor but fits my LG Muziq just fine) and a little screen cleaner that works nicely, so not a TOTAL loss I guess, but still irritating and disappointing. I got a Plantronics that fits and sounds great, so my pretty pink matching H500 will reside in the back of the kitchen junk drawer. Live and learn ;)
