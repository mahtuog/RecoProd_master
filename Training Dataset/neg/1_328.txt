This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static. The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations. Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it.Do yourself a favor and avoid this one.
