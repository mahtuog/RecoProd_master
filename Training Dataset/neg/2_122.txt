Pro: I charge it with the same cable as my Blackberry.Con: About 15% of the time, the other person hears an extreme/high-pitched noise that I can't hear or acknowledge.Since I use this phone for work, home, & everything in between, I have to discard this headset. For example, think about this noise happening when I host a client conference call where I'm the moderator. Then, the mess that ensues when I hang up & all others are automatically disconnected as a result.
