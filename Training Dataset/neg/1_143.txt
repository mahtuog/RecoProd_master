The battery I purchased does not hold the charge and shows obvious signs of wear on its outside wrapping. It is clear that this is not a new product. I am returning this item and requesting a refund. Unfortunately, I am stuck with paying the postage. I do not recommend that you use the vendor I used when getting this product.
