Long story short, I called Cingular for the first time today and spent nearly an hour trying to get someone there to port in my old number. What a frustrating and rotten experience, including being given the wrong number to call, and then being told that it was the wrong number (by a rather rude representative) after being put on hold for a long time. After some more bad customer service, I finally got to a supervisor and told him that this was perhaps the worst &quot;customer service&quot; I'd ever experienced, and that this was my first and last day with Cingular. I can not imagine ever needing to call them down the road for something and going through this type of frustrating hassle again. I am going to send the phone back and order another one with ANOTHER CARRIER! Too frustrating.
