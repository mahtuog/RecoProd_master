These work to charge your phone, but the casing around part that plugs into the phone is slightly wide, causing the plug to fall out of the phone easily. This is especially aggravating with the car charger. I think it's worth the money to get the better fitting items from Samsung.Also - why does Samsung change the plug in each phone model? The BlackJack 1 and Blackjack 2 do not use interchangeable plugs and my wife's Samsung flipphone uses a completely different connection. Are they trying to make money on peripherals and chargers?
