I have had this phone for about 5 months now and its had problems since the beginning within one day of having it the hindges started to sqeak on and off. About a month ago i could make absoutly no calls because their was a signal problem. and just a couple of days ago my volume got screwed up and now it can't go past level 3, which is VERY hard to hear. Another thing about this phone is the ringer it cannot be turned off ascending so you cant hear the ringtone untill about 20sec later. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE
