This phone is super-locked, means can be used with only active sim card. I purchased this phone as standby and for travel purpose. You can not used camera or fm radio without active sim card. I have several locked old phone, both gsm and cdma. I can use camera, music player, fm etc without any sim card or active service. I tried installing my old inactive sim card, but this phone is not accepting it. And without active sim card it will not turn on. I can get better and free phone with service.
