The phone and/or the service is very poor. The calls sound like I am talking to an alien. I have called Cingular to let them know and all I get is the run around. I was with verizon befor and had NO PROBLEMS with there service at all.I wanted to try cingulr because they have more phones to select from.I now regret going to Cingular and recommend you STAY as far away from them as you can.
