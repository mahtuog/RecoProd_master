I bought these thinking I could use them for both Skype and my cell. Connects and works fine for cell use (although the annoying blue light flash needs to go). But this headset does NOT work for Skype and Plantronics is clear (AFTER you buy the headset, nowhere is this mentioned on the package or product listing) that Skype/VOIP is NOT supported. I'm a pretty techie guy (build my own PCs., water and phase-change cool them) and I tried everything, several BT stacks and 3 different USB and internal dongles. A one-hundred and fifty dollar stereo bluetooth headset will not work for VOIP? The cheapest mono headsets will work, but not this? Absolutely unacceptable for a higher-end headset and the shifty Plantronics people should make this clear on the packaging. I hope Amazon will change the product details to reflect this.
