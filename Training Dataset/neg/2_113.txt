The phone itself is pretty good, feels comfy in the hand and the bottons protrude and "click" so it gives nice tactile feedback, something missing from almost every phone on the markey. So you know what you're pressing at all times, almost no texting errors.However, two flaws, and one of them is MAJOR.1. How can a phone not have an input for an earbud? This is absolutely unacceptable, and I've never seen a phone in the last 6-7 years not have a simple ear bud jack, ridiculous! This is the sole reason I returned mine, as I do not care for Bluetooth, I prefer simple corded earbuds as they are cheap to replace if lost.2. Another pretty serious flaw is the battery. It is rated at 3 hours, but that is pushing it.Overall this could have been a great phone, but two pretty stupid, unthinkable mistakes like not including a basic earbud jack ruins it.
