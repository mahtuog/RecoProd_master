When paired with my BlackBerry Curve, the Discovery 665 worked very poorly for me. In fairness, before condemning the Discovery 665 I would have to try it with other phones and/or try my phone with other Bluetooth headsets. But I don't have time for that. So I am only comparing this experience with past ones involving older phones and Bluetooth headsets, all of which worked much better.Using this unit with my Curve, during any call in progress (from initiation onward) I heard a subtle, but noticeable sound like a resonant hollow tube; I heard bad, deep distortion or choppy audio on my end; and the people I spoke with heard my voice subjected to heavy audio compression artifacts (like the swooshiness you hear in very low resolution mp3 audio.)The Discovery 665 seems to work well for others, but I am returning mine for a refund. I gave it two stars for good ergonomics and ease of setup and use.
