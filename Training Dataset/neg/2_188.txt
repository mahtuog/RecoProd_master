I enjoy the features of the phone, however there are too many kinks.I am on my second replacement since Mar '05. The first phone had a mysterious orange blob that seemed to migrate on the screen, and a strange humming. The replacement worked for one month and also has a strange hum. The third phone is in route via mail.I have not had any problems with Cingular. They don't seem surprised by my complaints and promptly send replacements. However, I am looking into purchasing a Blackberry, instead.
