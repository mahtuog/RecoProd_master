What a waste of time! This piece of junk disconnected the phone call; the system just frozen and not responded and the PDA system crashed ALL DAY LONG. Palm exchanged the phone 3 times in the last 6 months and they are all nightmares... Get the Sony P910 or Blackberry if you don't want your callers to get very upset.
