I only owned the phone for about two weeks and it was already acting up. First, the hinges became kind of squeaky and just felt horrible to hold the phone. Then, the battery wouldn't even charge. I plugged it into the charger and it looked like it was charging but when I pulled it out, it was still at one bar. And it went down to one bar overnight.. after I had charged it until it was supposedly full. It appears that other people had this problem as I saw people returning the same phone because of these issues.So I highly don't recommend it.
