This headset is not worth the money. In my case, it was not worth any money. It has a range of about the length of your arm. It does not work worth a darn outside of the car. It has a hissing sound in the background all the time. It crackles and pops most of the time. I love my Treo 650 but this headset stinks. I received this headset as a gift so it did not cost me anything yet I am still disatisfied and will be ordering a different brand. Take my advice, avoid this headset. If not, well, you were warned.Update: Recently purchased the new Treo 650 headset by PalmOne. That is the new Bluetooth 1.2 version, not the clone of this Jabra. Much, much better. Now I have a headset that I can use all the time. I have replaced all my other headsets.
