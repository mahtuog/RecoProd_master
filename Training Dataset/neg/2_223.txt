I've had this phone for an extremely unfortunate 6 months. The other day, it started making noise while on vibrate, so I had to get another one.Good:-display is big and not awful-you can close the phone while the earpeace is in-external ID-umm..reception is..acceptable? (I'm shooting for anything here).Bad:-enormous-flimsy-camera really sucks-screen gets dirty while talking-SLOWWWWW-most ringtones are obnoxious-just annoying and ugly2 out of 5, just don't get it. It's as simple as that. Get an E105 or V300 or something, just don't get this.
