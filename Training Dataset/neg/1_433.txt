This Jabra unit, the one listed as compatible with the 8200 and 8800 series, did not work with my 8260. A The phone did not detect a headset attached. A Jabra support person told me that there are known compatibility problems with some of the Jabra headsets designated for this series Nokia, however, according to Jabra these problems are now resolved. I will exchange my unit and try again. Note that many of the 8260 bundles come with a Nokia headset included.
