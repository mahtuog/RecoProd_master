The Plantronics Bluetooth adapter is a comfortable bluetooth headset that allows handsfree talking - especially useful for driving! Unfortunately, this is also where it is at it's weakest.Good: I like the car charger that accompanies the bluetooth set. They obviously know this is where it will be primarily used. You can even clip it to your AC Vent and it acts as a cradle and a charger! Sounds very good receiving calls in many conditions.Bad: The microphone on this unit has little to NO noise reduction whatsoever. I am constantly plagued with complaints about background noise while I'm driving. Apparently it sounds like I am in a wind tunnel! Many times people will cut their conversations short with me because it is so difficult to hear, and when they can they are hearing equally as much road noise/wind. Ironically when on my phone itself, there is no wind or other road noise. It appears to pick up some noises and amplify them in a bad way.Final Verdict - acceptable budget bluetooth adapter, but if you don't have a superbly insulated car you will likely get complaints about the background noise, even if very little even exists.
