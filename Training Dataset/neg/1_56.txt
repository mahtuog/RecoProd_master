This item arrived as advertised. We plugged the charger into our car and it did not work; no light, no charging. We thought it might be the port in the car. Tried others in the same car; it still did not work. We tried the charger in another car with the same results. We did not send the unit back due to the price we paid plus the shipping. I guess you do get what you pay for.
