Pictures taken with this phone can be useless if you use Verizon Wireless. As other reviews point out, Verizon requires you to use its photo download service - you can't transfer files using Bluetooth or USB. That's annoying, but it's just the tip of the iceberg - Verizon has actually made it IMPOSSIBLE to get some of your pictures off the camera. That's because the phone takes pictures, apparently even using the default settings, that sometimes exceed the file size limit imposed by Verizon. For example, I have pictures -- including pictures of a graduation where I had forgotten my "real" camera -- that Verizon tells me can't be printed, can't be uploaded to the web, and can't be sent to anyone else. They are locked in my phone because Verizon has disabled file transfer software to prevent customers from, for example, buying ring tones from someone other than Verizon. So, to lock in ring tone sales, Verizon has locked my pictures in my phone. Compounding the problem, Verizon hasn't told its customer service personnel, or its technical support staff, who seem to be under instructions to blame Motorola. I wasted hours talking to Verizon people -- both in person at their repair office, and at their customer service line -- before finding out the truth on-line and getting someone at Verizon who admitted what's really going on. This would be a good phone, but Verizon has ruined it. If you want to use this phone as a camera, make sure you have a wireless provider that will let you access the photos you take.
