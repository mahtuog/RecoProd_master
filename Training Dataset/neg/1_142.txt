I purchased 2 of these. First of all, the product image is wrong, because the image on Amazon clearly shows the BlackBerry logo, and the batteries I got are unmarked and with no logo or mention of the word BlackBerry.I could have gotten over that if the battery actually worked . . .The batteries are refurbished, and not new. (They were not sealed in plastic.) I put in the first battery, turned off my phone, and charged it overnight. The next day I unplugged it and carried the phone around as usual. By night (about 14 hours later), the battery was dead. Note that I did not make a single phone call that day. The phone was on Standby, and it died in 14 hours! My old battery was almost as good!Anyway, I bought two of them, as I said. The second one seems to be holding its charge somewhat, but I can see that the battery life indicator is already down to 75% after 10 hours of ZERO usage (all on standby).As far as I'm concerned, I was cheated into thinking the following (neither of which are true):1 - I was buying an original BlackBerry product (Note: I have complained about the image to Amazon, so I expect they will take action on this soon)2 - I was buying a new batteryI paid about $10 in total for these two batteries, and my time is more valuable than repackaging these and sending them back. My guess is that the seller is counting on exactly this psychology--that most of us will get annoyed for a couple of hours, and then realize that its not worth the time or attention.Well done, Mr & Mrs Fake-Battery-Seller. You got my money, but it's worth the 10 bucks for me to know never to go near you guys again.
