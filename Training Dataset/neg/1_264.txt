Phone Experience:Its light and sleek and does perform very well as basic phone, charge every 2 days not 2 times a day as I use to do with smartphone.This phone's interfaces are so old that looks like I am using those old bulky Nokia phones specially switching from smart-phone. This is slow and very limited capabilities. Krzr seems to have lot better interfaces.Verizon Experience:At least I am not getting that many dropped calls as it was with Cingular. Its much better reception.Some things that I encountered so far are: Verizon charges you for 1 month advance monthly access fee, so your first month with activation will cost $250-300 excluding phone cost. Next, they charged me $15 because I ported my old number, in past I received this service free with T-Mobile and Cingular.Customer service is not friendly at all.Amazon Experience:The sad part of my story starts when I received this phone.I opened the box and it looked like used phone, with dust inside plastic protector and edges coming off and scratches where Mini-SD card goes. I thought its not a big deal so I called Verizon, they came up with resolution after couple calls and hold time that goto store for a free replacement. I went to store, the lady kept trying but nothing happened then a answer that oh may be because you bought phone from Amazon and their customer service should take of this.Ha, who don't know on this earth that Amazon don't care for customer satisfaction at all. There is no one who can help you. After few emails I lost hopes and now stuck with this phone.Now I think I shouldn't have bought it from here, if it was thru Verizon at least I can get new phone.My 2 cents don't buy from here, its worth buying from Verizon directly in long term.
