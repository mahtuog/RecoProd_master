The transmitter has worked well for me, and the quality has been fine, but recently (after owning it for maybe half a year) the audio connector became very finicky. It had to be twisted to a certain angle to receive my mp3 player's audio, and would cut in and out (or not play at all) if jiggled or rotated. (I tried an adapter to see if it was my mp3 player being stubborn, but I can confirm it is the Monster cable that is not working). It is now so unusable I decided to throw it away.Otherwise, for when it worked, I had no complaints about it!
