this phone is very pretty, but it has many flaws- it crashes repeatedly, even during phone calls...it smudges quite easily and is very prone to scratching(so make sure to buy a case too)the reception is allright(sometimes there's an echo)-i use T-mobile, and if you look at the manual-you should get used to this phone in time. Bottom line: Not nearly as great as it seems-
