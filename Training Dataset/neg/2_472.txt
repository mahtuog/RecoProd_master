My wife and I both have this phone, and while it is an acceptible gizmo with plenty of features, after over a year, I still hate the UI compared to Nokia. Maybe subjective, but I have to hit waaay too many buttons to get things done.The joystick has gone wonky on both of our phones, I'm guessing this is not uncommon.Not enough space to store more than a couple of poor quality photos.
