I've had this phone since October. I got it because it was so small and adorable. At first I was happy with it...but once I actually started using it, that all changed. Good news first..PROS:-Loud volume-Easy to use-Lots of included ringtones..some are cute, some are a little out there-Voice recorderCONS:-CONSTANTLY drops calls-Recieves text messages HOURS after people send them-VERY small text messages--160 characters...most phones have over 800-The buttons make a very loud clicking noise sometimes so you have to shut off the phone for a few minutes-Bad battery life..if you send a few messages a day and talk on the phone for a few minutes, you're gonna have to charge it all night-You can't have real music tones-Voice recorder can't be your ringtone-Very bad speaker interference..I have to keep it a few feet away from the computer/tv and anything else with speakersI wish more people would have said bad things about this phone before I bought it! Stay away from this phone if possible..
