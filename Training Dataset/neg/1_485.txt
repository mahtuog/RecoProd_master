H.J Spivack's review (12/17/04) is dead-on! I have experienced the same issues and frustration with Cingular & this phone. My advice, get a different phone & service. Received the first phone in June 2004 and now in May 2005, I am on the fifth phone. Each time a problem has come up (buttons didn't work, display stops working, phone answered the call on its own (while sitting on the desktop), etc.), the service has been tremendously awful (1 hr on the phone) and my only viable option is to receive another refurbished phone. The company tells me the replacements are "reconditioned" and suggested I contact Motorolla. Even after clearly articulating I was dissatified with the quality of the phone and service, my request for a refund and/or different phone at their cost was denied. This company is not customer friendly or interested in maintaining any level of customer service or satisfaction. Add to that poor phone performance and it is a lose-lose scenario.
