I owned it for 2 months now. The first time I got the phone, it jammed on me. The key pads on the phone was not to responding. When I get an incoming call, I tried to accept the call by pressing the &quot;yes&quot; button, it didn't take it. I exchanged a new phone with T-mobile, the second phone worked for 1 week. After that, it jammed on me again. Sony Ericsson T610 is definitely not a reliable phone. If one has a emergency, that would be a disaster because the phone key locks all the time. I can't wait till my contract ends so I can get out of this horrible phone and service. Also, signal is terrible. It doesn't work in buildings at all.
