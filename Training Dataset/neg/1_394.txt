Don't make the same mistake that I did. The phone is why I signed up for T-Mobile (it really should be free..the resolution on the screen & digital camera is poor to say the least)..but what is the use of the phone when you can't even make phone calls during your "unlimited minutes." I am lucky to even have a phone call go through without receiving a "message failed" or "network busy" signal. When my calls do go through, they are usually cut off in mid conversation. I called the customer service center...and their response was...well yes we do know that this is a problem in your area but have no immediate plans of extending your coverage area. Now I am stuck with a contract and a nice phone...but no coverage. The coverage in my area is even listed officially as GREAT by T-mobile. AVOID T-MOBILE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
