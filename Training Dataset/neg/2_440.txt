the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20. Sony took my address and said they would, but it never showed up.Well the phone is rugged! It's been 3-4 years and it still works. It went through the washing machine and half the dryer. It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes- it keeeps working.The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc. I buy a $25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes. It's been a great little phone.
