I purchased this headset Friday 12/2/2005 from the Alltell office. I used it for the first time on Monday 12/12/2005.Pros: Excellent headset speaker. Best I've ever heard.All features work great!!Cons: Extream back ground noise. Very poor sound quality to the person on the other end. If you drive a Tractor-Trailer truck as I do, forget this headset.DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET!!!
