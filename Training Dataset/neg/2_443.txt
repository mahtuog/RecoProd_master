I was very excited when I first received this phone. I loved the solid feel and construction, metal casing, small but evenly spaced keys, good keypad backlighting, large color display, and a host of fabulous features, such as voice dialing, integrated camera, and picture ID for messages as well as incoming calls. Small and compact, it fits very nicely in the pocket of close-fitting jeans without making an uncomfortable or unsightly bulge.I was heartbroken when I realized that it had such a weak antenna that it dropped calls in some areas of downtown DC, which is unacceptable. I had to trade the phone in for a much less sexy Nokia, which, while not my dream phone, at least works as a phone.If Sony Ericsson were to get the signal strength issues sorted out on this device, I would definitely go for it. As it is, it won't do.PROS:- Small, compact design- Solid construction, metal case- Internal antenna- Beautiful MMS and SMS interface- Easy access to T-Zones- Built-in camera- Photo ID for incoming MMS, SMS, and voice calls- Fabulous color displayCONS:- Extremely poor radio reception- Extremely poor radio reception (oops, I repeat myself)- Display somewhat hard to see in bright daylight- Headset jack exclusive to Sony-Ericsson, which makes it difficult to replace the hands-free unit if you happen to lose it.It would be the perfect phone if it had a mini (2.5 mm) headset jack, and signal strength as good as my new Nokia.
