After a month of use on this phone I have enough input to rate it. I am on the T-mobile network. I have owned Nokia 5160, 6162, and 8265.First the positives :)1. Very stylish2. Camera function3. Attaches pictures to call contacts4. Decent graphics and colors5. Blue tooth6. Black Jack game - sonyericsson.com7. Good polyphonic sound8. Reliable - Hasn't crashed or got stuck9. Small- not a bother to carry aroundNegatives :(1. Piss poor reception at times, my other phone got better reception- May be t-mobile2. The novelty of a camera on a phone has worn off and the pictures are fuzzier than a truck driver's back.3. Battery easily drained - 48 hours without charging and you're dead..er it's dead4. Slow loading t-zones5. Not user friendly6. Takes a long time to do anything esp. write sms7. Calculator is limited8. Buttons are so close together it strains your fingers and you will make many keypad mistakes - Also hard to write messages9. Scrolls slowly; hard to go through call contacts and doesn't go to second letter in contact list10. Hard to hold in your hand esp. with long calls- small11. Scratches easily and the screen gets so dirtyHope this helps. That's all I can think about right now. I am used to Nokia but the idea of a camera phone made me curious and the 3650 was too large. Nokia 6600 camera phone with camera will be out soon. I'd give it 2.5 stars right in the middle but there was none, so I went down. Don't buy this novelty phone if you log a lot of minutes!
