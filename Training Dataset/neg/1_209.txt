ANTOnline sent a Lenmar battery were the case was barley held together by scotch tape on both ends once I open the package. The box was smashed but packaging was not. Emailed right away as instructed and waited for RMA or contact back. No response. Tried again plus tried calling but still no response so then I emailed Amazon. Amazon gave me a full refund after their investigation of the problem. Thank you Amazon.
