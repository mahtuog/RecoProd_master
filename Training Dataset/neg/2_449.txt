I give this phone 2 stars because it has great features including bluetooth, and the Iinfared port among other cool things. I've had this phone for 2 years. Reception Sucks! My buddy has always had better reception when standing next to each other (nokia). And i have had the experience of poor connection wen charging, u have to jiggle it. It is also very slow at times, and had ocassions when it totally bugged out on me. Whats the point in having a cool phone with a lot of features if the reception is god awefull. I expected better from Sony. Im switching to the Nokia 3220.
