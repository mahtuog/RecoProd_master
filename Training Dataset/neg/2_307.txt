See my review of the Coby CA-745 transmitter for some background.I purchased this Monster RadioPlay 300 based on the price and overall rating. It arrived broken and used. The wire near the socket connector was positional, meaning that it was broken inside and only worked when the wire was at a specific angle; the wire dangles and swings when driving, so the transmitter was unusable. Plus, the display and body were both scratched up a lot, so I concluded that the company sent me one that had been returned because it was broken. I assume that the Quality Control program in their shipping/receiving department needs better management. When I contacted the seller, they apologized, refunded my money AND sent me a new one at no cost, so I'd say their PR department is great!The replacement works, and is adequate, but when I received the Coby transmitter (which I had ordered right after receiving the first Monster), I was blown away at how much better the latter one is, and at a comparable price.So the bottom line is, the company has a QC problem which they can fix, and I wish them the best of luck. Their quick and unsolicited response of refunding my purchase price and sending me a workable replacement is a good sign that they are trying, so kudos to them for their effort. As for the transmitter itself, it's okay but just not as good as the Coby.
