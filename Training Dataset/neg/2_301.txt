I was disappointed with the sound when using this device with my Zune 8GB. I only needed to listen for about 10 minutes before deciding it was not for me (I gave it two different chances). The music I played sounded a bit "muffled" to me--a little like I was listening to AM radio. I am not an audiophile, but I am an amateur musician--and I do listen carefully. I want to listen carefully. I found the music frustrating to listen to. Maybe I am a little spoiled by the better sound results produced using my old cassette adapter. I definitely prefer the sound produced using my cassette adapter. My next car stereo will no doubt have a stereo jack. If the cassette module in my car stereo were to break tomorrow, I would rather pay $250 to have a new stereo installed in my car than use this device. Perhaps it's just a fact that all FM transmitters are "limited". I noticed that MonsterCable did not make any guarantees about sound quality on their packaging. I suppose the device does produce "stereo sound"--but it's not nearly as nice a sound as FM radio. If you are satisfied with the sound of AM radio (I enjoy listening to AM radio on occasion), then you may be completely satisfied using this device. I hope that someone finds this review helpful.
