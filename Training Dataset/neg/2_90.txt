The Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not ready to be utilized in the business enviroment. I have used it for three months with the new Sanyo Multimedia 7400 phone, I found: a VERY SHORT battery life, average reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 10 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive noise in the background when a moderate wind is blowing.
