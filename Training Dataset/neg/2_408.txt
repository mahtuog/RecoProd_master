I did not take the complaints about reception seriously since my house and office are both within a mile of major highways, and when my friends visited me with their t-mobile phones they got full strength signals in both places. Boy I was wrong.The signal meter was a joke - it jumps from 4 bars to 1 bar in a second while the phone sat still on a desk, then jumped back, etc.. -- and I thought it was just the meter; but the reception is really that unreliable -- the voice quality keeps varying and while standing at a spot that I got 3 bars when the call started, it would all of sudden drop to 0 bar and actually drop the call (on one occasion I was talking to T-mobile customer service and the call dropped the moment I got through the waiting -- pretty ironic).The phone has lots of features, but the navigation system design is very clumsy. Especially annoying is the lack of a shortcut back to the main/standby mode (the "end" button on most phones). Since the buttons are so small, it is very easy to accidentally get deep in some unwanted menus; to get out you'll have to repeatedly press "return". Such a pain.And yes, the screen is not bright enough to be viewed outdoors, and the body/lcd is always smeared with fingerprints or dusts due to the shiny, static-loving finish. (the lcd cover is also very easily scratched.)I'd give 1 star, but the price is not too bad (of course, if either of the rebate fails to go thru, this would be a realy bad deal).
