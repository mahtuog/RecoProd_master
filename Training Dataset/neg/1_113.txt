This phone is horrible. I live in the middle of a big city and i dont get reception in my own house. People sound gargled and like their in a tunnel. The mirror on the front get scratched way to easily. I think the only thing cingular was thinking of when the made this phone was the size. it is the worst phone i have ever owned. DONT BUY IT. Its a waste of money. Find a better phone that might be bigger, but at least u will be able to talk on it. :( I wish i could give it lower than a 1 as a rating. I would give it a -5.
