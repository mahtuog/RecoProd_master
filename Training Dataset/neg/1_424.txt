The item was fine. However, it would not work on my wireless network (not at all clear from the description), so I had to return it. I was promised credit minus a 10% restocking fee IF AND ONLY IF I wrote a review favorable to the seller, which I did. To date (February 8, 2008) my card has not been credited. I have never had a bad transaction through Amazon until this one, but I would not recommend that anyone do business with this ethically challenged seller.
