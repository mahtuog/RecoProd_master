Cons- Everything about this phone is bad......really bad. The sound for one thing does not sound like polyphonic it is very fuzzy and some of the tones in the songs downloaded from the T-Moble web site are missing (the sony ericsson t300 has better sound than this phone).The camera is svery bad on the screen of the phone unless you are outside with alot of light.The pictures will come out horrible until you send them to your computer then their ok. Their is only one game motoGP and that with the camera takes up all the memory (so unless u delete somthing you wont be able to add any more games). The menu screen is very slow to move.the colors are bad they are not that vivid and the backgrounds that it comes with it are dark and if you try to brighten the screen of the phone the picture turns almost white. The phone is very slow. I had to return my phone twice to fix the charger on the phone because it never charges and the camera it oftenly not detected.you have to put it in more than 4 times for both the charger or camera to work. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE FOR 2 REASONS THE PRICE OF SUCH A HORRIBLE PHONE (SHOULD BE FREE) AND THE QUALITY OF THIS PHONE.Pros- this phone are it is flip,changeable covers,battery life (can be better).This phone is reception is ok and the ear piece sound is good (can be louder).
