It LOOKS like a good product, right? Yet it is not. I used this device for 3 days before having to return it. Most of the tiem you can hear the other person, but they can *barely* hear you. And G-d forbid you have to use it in the *slightest* of windy conditions - you won't be able to hear anything and the other person will think you are sitting on the wing of an airplane. Skip this product folks...
