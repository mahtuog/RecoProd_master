I have this phone from past 6 months from T-Mobile, first of all usability is cumbersome, you have to click lot of buttons even for small things. next reception is very poor, my wife has Samsung E105 from T-Mobile, thatworks every where in the house and T610 does not, it will drop calls if i move from one room to other and in some rooms it will have no signal. it only shows half the signal strength of what e 105 shows in most of the places.Dont fall for the looks, its a beauty with no brains.
