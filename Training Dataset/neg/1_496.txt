I bought this charger for my Pantech PN-215. I am most disappointed. It charged my phone twice andthen quit working. Just sparks in the electrical wall socket, the green light refuses to go on and nothing willcharge. Don't buy this product. I am very disappointed because I paid the higher cost for this item thinking I was buying a good product. Now, I have to find another vender and in the meantime, I have no working cell phone! This was a waste of $16 by the time I paid postage. Beware.
