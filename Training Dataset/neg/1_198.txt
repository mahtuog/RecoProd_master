Got the headset and paired it with my new computer. Could hear just fine, but the microphone was not picking up any sound. The documentation sent with the headset was useless as was the Plantronics web site. So I called and talked to a Platronics service representative. Told the representative the problem and was told he didn't know what was wrong, end of conversation. Put the headset back in the package and sent it back. Until Plantronics gets customer service people that do more than tell you they don't know and hang up, I won't be buying again.
