I thought the Jabra FreeSpeak would be a much better bluetooth headset than a lot of other products on the market. Boy was I wrong! Once I got started with the headset, I heard a lot of static on my end and the people I called could barely hear anything I was saying.Heaven help you if you have an 802.11x setup at home! I have a wireless network at home which seemed to cause a lot of interference with my headset. Even when I tried the headset on the road or elsewhere, the static was unbearable. You could barely keep the headset 1 foot away from your phone before you started hearing static.I returned this puppy back to Best Buy the very next day.I have since purchased the Bluetooth headset from Logitech which works GREAT!!Note: I have a Sprint PPC-6601 phone
