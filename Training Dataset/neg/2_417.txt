This phone has bad software and also hardware. I have this phone and it reboots whenever there is less signal and I am on the call.Some time it hangs forever, you need to remove the battery to restart that. Beside this the conductors (charger and head phone) are bad after a while the phone stop charging. I complained about this to t-mobile and they have given a new phone (T610 again) and I am using this, don't know how long I can use it. One of my friend also got this phone and his cell phone stop charging after 5 months. I am now desperate to get any Basic model of Nokia phone instead of this. T-mobile has condition where they can't exchange with any other model if it has crossed more than 2 weeks.This phone also doesn't have good reception.The camera is not great.Ring tone is good.If you seriously looking for bluetooth, camera and infrared feature, I will suggest for Nokia 6600. In my family plan the another phone is Nokia 6600, it has very good reception. Beside this it has good speaker phone, ofcouse the camera is much better than T610.
