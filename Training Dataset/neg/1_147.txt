I placed an order for 4 Blackberry 8800 series battery. Of the 4, 3 were defective (middle bowed). Contacted customer service, was told to toss the old and 3 replacements would be sent. Following day got an email with a credit, no explanation. This was the total opposite of what was told to me the day before. Very disaapointed witht the service and process.
