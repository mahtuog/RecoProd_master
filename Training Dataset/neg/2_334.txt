keep in mind this costs 49 cents. it does protect my iPhone, and it does have a non-slip grip. however, it doesn't fit well. the parts immediately above and below the screen are permanently lifted about a centimeter away from the screen. also - and this amazed me - there's no hole for your headphones! you have to manually cut it out yourself. I recommend nail clippers.if you want something really cheap, go for it. but it'll probably annoy you because it doesn't fit.
