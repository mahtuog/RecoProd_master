The case is fine, but the belt clip is terrible! When pressing the clip to put it on (or take it off) your belt, its extremely hard to open more than a tiny bit. Their old style had a metal spring design that worked well. This new design is only a piece of plastic that must be flexed. I went to the Verizon store and found a one that worked perfect for less money.
