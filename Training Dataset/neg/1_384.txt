If you plan to use this in a car forget about it. The microphone is short and sits along your cheek. This means whoever you are talking to will mostly hear car noise rather than whatever you are trying to say. Add to this an ear piece that falls out if you blink, and I amlooking to buy yet another hands free set for my car.
