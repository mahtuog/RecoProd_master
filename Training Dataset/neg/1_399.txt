I had this phone for about 5 days before I wanted to toss it out the window. It rings when there is no call comming in and WONT STOP. I returned it to the store where I bought (T-mobile) it but because it had been 35 days instead of 30, they said they could not exchange it for a new one but would give me a &quot;previously used&quot; phone. After 5 replacements, I bought a NOKIA. The camera sucks, and the battery life and signal suck too.
