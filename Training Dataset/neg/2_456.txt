I have had this phone for a week now and today I had to go exchange it for another one. The phone suddenly will not turn off and has a blank white screen. It won't do anything. The man at the T-Mobile store said the battery stopped working properly and I needed a new phone. The battery was charging all night long and then this morning the battery died. It is extremely hard to get reception. I am in a major metropolitan area in Southern California and have to try at least twice to make any calls, to find a signal, which is a weak one at best. I am very disappointed with this phone and with the fact that I will be without a cell phone for 5 days while I wait for a new one to ship from the factory. Hopefully the newer one will work better.
