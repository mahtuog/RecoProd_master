I wish I could give this 0 stars. I got this for my Palm TX, but as another reviewer experienced, the damn case wouldn't close!! The screw on the back doesn't seem very stable either. I just sent BoxWave an email complaining about this and demanding all of my money back, including shipping charges. What a crappy product. I think I'm going to try the Rhinoskin one instead.
