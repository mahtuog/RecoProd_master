CAVEAT EMPTOR - This thing buzzes like a bumblebee on steroids. Not even worth 10 bucks, let alone the 40 I paid at Radio Shed.I would only use this thing under the following 2 conditions:1) it was given to me free; and2) it was the only earset available (i.e., avoiding brain tumors).Otherwise, AVOID THIS EARSET AT ALL COSTS!!!
