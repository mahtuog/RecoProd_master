I bought this to recharge my phone, garmin, etc. It looks like the authentic Motorola recharger, but it won't recharge anything. Sure, it keeps the device working, almost, your device will run out of power eventually on this recharger, but slowly. However, I figured it would recharge the Garmin, etc, during use like my other rechargers did. I thought perhaps the LED light was using up too much power. I dismantled the thing after a great deal of effort and injury, and knocked out the light. It will now charge my Garmin very well. I don't recommend this product.
