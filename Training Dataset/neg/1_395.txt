I've had this phone for about 1 month now, and already there is dust trapped under the screen and it is almost impossible to get out. The phone features are ok, not the best. The major let down of this thing is that the screen gets dust under it non-stop making it impossible to even see the screen most of the time. I've tried taking it to T-Mobile, and they said they'd try to repair it, but if they broke it...they wouldn't replace it. That got me fired up. This phone is ok feature wise, but has a terrible build to it. DONT GET IT!!!
