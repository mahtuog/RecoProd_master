I originally liked the looks of the phone just because it looked cool. It arrived this week and I was still impressed. It is small...light...attractive. Then I took it outside and as soon as sunlight hits it, you can't see the screen. The features are clunky...difficult to figure out basic things which i was used to with Sprint. The reception was also terrible. I was able to get 4 bars signal strength at my house, then I took it to work and got no signal. Granted I work in of all places...a building. I then took it to the mall here in Charlottesville to check the signal there and all I received was 1-2 bars...but the mall is an outdoor mall. I am just going to return it and hope I get better service from something other than T-Mobile.
