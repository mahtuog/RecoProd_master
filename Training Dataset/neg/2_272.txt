I finally found an ear piece for my 2 year old Nokia phone. However, the ear insertion doesn't stay in my ear and constantly falls out. So, I'm using my hand to keep the ear piece in my ear. Also, hearing volume is not effective. Annoying, but can't do anything about it.However, I've discovered you can find stuff on Amazon and that's a good thing.
