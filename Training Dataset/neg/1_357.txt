I've gone through about seven of these clips in the last two years. I can't warn you enough -- don't buy this, because you're only getting a short-term lease.I broke most of them while sitting down in my car. It turns out that it doesn't take a lot of force placed on the bottom of the phone to torque the clip apart.I'm here on Amazon searching for a sturdier solution, but in the meantime, the phone stays in my pocket.
