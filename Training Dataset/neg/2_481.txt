I've been a T610 owner for about 4 months. The phone has a sleek design, decent camera functionality, and well, I'll skip all the details you could get from an ad. Let's cut to the chase. The T610 is a horrible phone. A common problem among many T610 owners, is that the phone freezes for no apparent reason. You cannot turn it off, half the buttons malfunction, and you are left with removing and reinserting the batter more than a couple of times. This has happened nearly 5 times in 4 months. My sister can attest to the same problem.Here are more annoyances. You cannot disable Increasing Ring. The phone will occasionally fail to charge. Loading themes are slow. My final gripe is that the power button might be too difficult to reach.I think the T610 is a mediocre phone. Oh, I forgot to mention bad reception. Replacing my old Nokia 8290 with this phone was a bad idea.
