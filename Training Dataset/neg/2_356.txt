The title says it all. I don't have weird ears, a big or small head or anything, it's just hard plastic that causes ear irritation if worn for more than a half hour or so. I can't recommend this product.When it is in use, the quality of the sound is a little chunky and digital sounding compared to my Motorola Bluetooth headset. I don't think a headset should EVER introduce noise to a conversation, but this one does.I gave it two stars instead of one because it does function as advertised, but beyond that it's painful and annoying.
