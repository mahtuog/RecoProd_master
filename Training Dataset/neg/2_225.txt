Do not buy the phone for the Camera. If you are looking for a great camera phone, the picture quality of the Samsung v205 is Much better. However, I am disappointed with the battery life of both..The Motorola T722i is fast.. the color screen is not as bright as the Samsung-- (I cant help but compare the two). However.. iside for apearances.. the motorola has twice as manny accessories and features (including the desktop speakerphone.. and mp3 player addons) so if you are into little gadgets like those, its a great phone. OR.. you can wait until the new Sony Erickson gets to the US-- which has a touch pad face and the features of both without all the addons :-)
