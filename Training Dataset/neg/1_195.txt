&lt;WARNING> It doesn't work with Skype &lt;WARNING>I also bought this headseat thinking it would work between iTunes and Skype. It doesn't. By reading the product description, it seemed to be the case where it talks about "switch from listening to music when a call comes in". I read that thinking it meant a Skype call. What they didn't include was they mean a call coming in on your paired CELL PHONE. I'm not happy and feel duped. It should be extremely clear that it wasn't designed to work with Skype on your computer -- it doesn't so don't bother if your a Skype user.
