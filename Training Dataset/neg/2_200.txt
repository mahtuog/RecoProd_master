Like others, I thought the higher price of this keyboard would equate to higher quality. I was wrong...very, very wrong. The keyboard itself is flimsy, much thinner than the $24 competitor I got. The power switch is incredibly flimsy, I can't tell if it's on or not. The keyboard seems much looser than the competitor when closed -- it's not very comforting. Tactile feedback is not as good as the cheaper alternative. And somehow, this keyboard drains my battery like crazy -- sending several short text messages with no other activity took my phone from 100% to 92%. This behavior happened more than once, and again the alternative does not show the same behavior. Even the charging port is flimsy, I really had to work to get the mini usb connector attached, and was afraid I was going to break it.The only reason this isn't one star is I have not experienced the pairing issues others have described. Price to quality ratio would make this less than one star, especially since all these issues are corrected in an alternative that costs a quarter as much.
