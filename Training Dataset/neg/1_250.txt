I also have a problem with this holster not staying on my person. Although, my problem with the holster is that I have it clipped to my belt but the holster sometimes comes off by itself and I blame this on the design. All you have to do to get the case off is turn it 90 degrees and pull up. I have a PDA case with a similar design but it requires you to push a lever to have the case come off and it has never accidentally come of because of that lever. I have had the Siemens case come off many times when I was sitting and yesterday it came off on the street when I was reaching for something. It's a good thing a good samaritan found my phone and contacted me or else I would be out a phone. This is a good case if you don't plan on keeping the case on your belt but if you do I would look for something else. I currently have a Krusell case on order to replace this one. After yesterday's incident I don't plan on using it anymore.
