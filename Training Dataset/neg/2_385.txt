I bought 2 of these, one for my wife and myself. I did a few tests and it seemed to work well... until I called my wife while she used her headset. The sound would continually cut out, and a conversation was possible. At first I thought it must be interference because we were in the same room. So we tried it again on the road when we were over 10 miles apart, but could only get the same results. Customer support was no help at all.
