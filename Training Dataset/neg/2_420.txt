I gave this product 2 stars because of the following flaws:- (Very) short battery life- Lower than average reception- Very slow about trying to find signal after it lost it- Low res camera- Usability issues with menus- Screen scratches very easilyIt gets 2 stars and not 1 because of the following qualities:- Nice small size- Nice screenI owned the Sony Ericsson T300 and decided it was time to upgrade. I was excited about getting this phone but it's half a year after and I wish I hadn't. The battery life of this phone is very short. I have to charge it aproximately every 3 days (a friend has the same phone and has the same problem). One of the reasons might be that it has very bad reception and may be wasting a lot of power trying to find service (I didn't have that problem with the T300).The camera of the T300 was able to take pictures at 640x480(!!), the camera of the T610 can only take a max of 320x240. Quite disappointing.As for the menus, you can use the number keys to quickly jump to an option in the list. Unfortunately, the designers forgot to number the list! You can either count the items and figure out the number of the item you want, at which point you may as well scroll.
