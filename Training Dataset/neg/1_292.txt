Recently, I've been having problems with charging my Samsung N400 phone. I have a charger with a single prong that fits into the phone base. Unfortunately, the socket of my phone is rather loose and sometimes the charger doesn't make a connection.I purchased this charged because the picture showed a multi-pin plug to fit in the alternate interface on my phone. I required this interface since my single prong socket was loose/damaged. The charger I received does not match this picture as it has the traditional single prong. Granted, it does work for the Samsung N400, but doesn't match the product picture so in a sense was falsely advertized.Secondly, the plug that goes into the cigarette lighter has a lead post that is sprint loaded. This ensures it makes contacts with the cigarette lighter recepticle. However, this lead post presses into the charger head and does not spring out; it sticks. In other words, it doesn't make contact with the cigarette lighter socket and therefore doesn't conduct electricty to charge my phone.False or inaccurate advertizing coupled with shoddy construction left me very disappointed with this purchase.I would not recommend this product.
