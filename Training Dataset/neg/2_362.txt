This was the 1st bluetooth I purchased and I didn't want to spend over $40. It is easy to use, as advertised but the sound quality isn't great. It picks up alot of background noise and my own voice was not loud enough to the people I was calling. I returned this and purchased a better, but more expensive bluetooth.
