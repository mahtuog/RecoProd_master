I have had this phone with T-Mobile plan for 6 months now. As Amazon was offering a great deal on it, I and 2 of my friends bought it together.First friend's experience:He is happy with phone. Works great. Reception is great. He gets great singals in his house and other confined palces.My experience:Very bad signal strength. In the same room where my above mentioned friend has a great singal strength, my phone is totally out of signals. And now, the display has developed a patch. Perhaps LCD has burnt out. I called Sony for repaire. They want me to mail it to some place and I will have to be without phone for 8-10 days. They are not willing to provide a replacement.Second friend's experienceHis phone went dead just in two days. He got a replacement. That wend deat also. He got a third phone and he has OK signal strength (not really great, not bad either).One common problem that we all have faced is that during some operations it freezes completely and we have to reboot the phone (I guess some bug in phone OS)
