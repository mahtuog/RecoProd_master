I'm giving this product 2 stars because Eforcity shipped quickly and when I emailed them about the inability of the battery to hold a charge for very long they quickly shipped a replacement free of charge. Good customer service. Unfortunately, the second battery exhibits the same behavior, holding a charge---with extremely light phone use---for about half the time the original Motorola battery did. So I strongly suspect these are not real Motorola batteries, or they are simply too old to work properly.
