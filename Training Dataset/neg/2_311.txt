I wanted to listen to podcasts on ipod classic. I read reviews before ordering and was hoping to be one of those that found it worked well. Didn't happen for me. There was too much interference once I neared the city and audio became bad -- too much static, like a weak radio station. Since that is my regular commute and the reason for the purchase, using this product just doesn't perform well for me. I've reverted to making cd's if there's something I want to listen to on the drive. It's a pain but the audio is clear, which is important when listening to spoken word.
