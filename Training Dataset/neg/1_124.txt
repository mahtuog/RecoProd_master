I take great care of my phone, yet this phone has a camaera that no longer takes pictures, it constantly drops calls (for whatever reason), it has horrible ringtones (unless you like really bad elevator music or the sound of very light bells). It's slow to respond to dialing too.I have had this phone for one year.
