Well...Two of the main differences between Verizon's Razrs, and the ones that come fromT-Mobile, and Cingular are as follows:difference #1:CDMA vs. GSMOnly the Verizon Razr runs on their CDMA network. The CDMA network sucks electricity out of the phone like a vampire!They say: "200 hours standby" vs "400 hours standby" on a GSM Razr.Your actual time may vary.My actual battery life was: 20 minutes of use within a 28 hour period of standing by, and the phone was beeping loudly that the battery was completely dead! And No, I did not listen to any music, or watch Vcast, or anything like that.difference #2:Bluetooth:Verizon shuts off the OBEX portion of the bluetooth that Motorola put into the phone when they built it.What that means is: You can not transfer anything to or from the handset via bluetooth. Take a picture, or video? Pay us to email it to yourself. Music? Your Own Ringtones? Buy those from us too.One note: I did not get mine from Amazon, I got it from Verizon directly.Verizon's customer service is also very lame. If they ever get my account straightened out, I AM GOING TO get my next phone from Amazon,and it will be from T-Mobile, or Cingular.
