I am actually back here to buy a replacement... I bought two of these and my husbands fell apart within a week. During that week we used them, they had the WORST echo or feedback sound. The name brand sold me, but the name is not enough to make this a good product. I have spent thousands at Amazon and this is the first thing I bought that was absolutely the pits. Too bad I bought two, and even worse yet, didn't return them for credit. Ugh, go look at something else!
