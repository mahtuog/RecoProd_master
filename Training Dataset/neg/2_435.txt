This seems like one of the best phones around. The looks are simply superb, the screen is cool, navigation too is easy. I got this phone with Tmobile and was hoping that will get better reception than the Motorola V60g that I have now. Surprisingly, the old phone is able to receive some signal even in places where T610 loses the network.The Bluetooth option is a cool one. With a good Head Set you don't need to press any button to make or receive calls(provided the phone receives the call).The camera could have been better. The resolution is pathetic.The phone does not give any error message when it fails to complete a call due to loss of Signal.Other than this weak reception, and few minor glithes the phone is great.
