After reading the reviews on here in December (there were only about 15-20 at that time), I decided that even though this probably wouldn't be the best Bluetooth Headset on the market, it might be the best for the price. It had mostly good reviews at that time.So I bought it. I was so excited! I loved that it didn't have the over-the-ear thing 'cause I hate those things! Well, it seemed good at first - great functions, loved the way it fit with the rubber tail, extremely light.... BUT then I actually started using it - Once I made some adjustments to the rubber ear plug, I could hear people on the other end just fine, but the problem is that they always seemed to complain of getting bad feedback or me sounding like I was in a tunnel. So I always end up taking it off Bluetooth and just using the phone after about 5 minutes 'cause my friends can't stand it.Oh well. I guess the moral to this lesson is this... Bluetooth is still a fairly new technology with a lot of room for improvement, and at this point the only way to get a really great Bluetooth headset is to pay the big bucks ($75+) for one with the latest greatest best technology. If you're like me and you can't afford to do that, then you're probalby best off waiting until the technology improves and prices come down, because, yeah, I got this headset at a great price, but since it's worthless, I'd have been better off spending that money on something I could actually use (like groceries - hehe).
