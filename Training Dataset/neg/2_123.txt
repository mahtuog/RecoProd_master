I purchased 2 of these and they both suffered the same fate: a broken belt clip. The belt clip snapped off when I bumped the holster (bound to happen when you're wearing it on your side). The case itself is great, love that it allows the pearl to recognize that it's in the holster, but to me is worthless without a sturdier clip.For what it's worth, the seller is great it's just the product that isn't.
