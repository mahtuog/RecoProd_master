Bought two of these and it always breaks in the same place after several months of use, if not sooner. Other reviewers have had the same experience. The problem lies with the plastic slide where you attach your Palm. It is flimsy and not detailed properly re. interface with the metal case itself. It invariably breaks after several openings/closings, if not before. I had a Rhino case before on another Palm and it looks as if I will have to try that or a leather one again.
