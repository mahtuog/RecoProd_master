I bought three of these when they first came out for me and two associates. Within 2 weeks, mine stopped working and shortly thereafter so did the other two. I have since replaced 6 of them and my associates replaced them twice and gave up. The little prongs on the headset that insert into the phone keep breaking. For the limited time the product was functioning I loved it. True the foam earpiece fell off immediately, but even without it, I found it comfortable. I only wish the darn thing would work for more than a few days. I have since given up replacing them and I wish they would improve the design because they are very convenient. One last thing, because it is so small people who are not familiar with headsets are going to look at you like you've gone nuts...talking to yourself when actually the phone is being used.
