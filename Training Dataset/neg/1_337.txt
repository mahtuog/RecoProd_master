I've had this phone for 8 months and since then Palm had replaced my Treo 600 4 times. I've never dropped nor scratched it but it's just the phone itself that's messed up. Every now and then there's a problem with this phone but I will still keep it coz I paid so much on this cr*p.For those of you who are thinking of getting a palmOne Treo 600, think over 100 times first okay?!HoneybeeChicago, IL
