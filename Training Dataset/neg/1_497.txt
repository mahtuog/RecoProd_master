First let me say the leather case is excellent quality and exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately the belt clip does not function correctly which caused me to lose a brand new Evo within a week of purchase. The clip has a screw which is supposed to lock in place and be released with finger pressure on a button at the top of the clip. This is the part that was wholly non-functional. Most of the time when I push the button, I could not get the clip to release no matter how hard I pulled on it. Then it appearently just fell out of this same clip (the clip was still attached to my belt) with virtually no pressure while I was walking across a parking lot. If you buy this product make sure your phone is insured.
