First of all the way it fits in your ear is very badly designed. The small rubber piece that looks like a tail is always poping out of your ear making the headset fall out.Sound quality and range are also inferior quality. I returned the headset for a refund the first week I had it. I now have the Plantronics Voyager 510, it is the best bluetooth headset I have ever owned.
