Motorola has been a leading cell phone manufacture. But I am disappointed with this phone. Some of the features are not working properly. There is display delay of 2 seconds. Some button presses do not respond all the time. The display quality is not good as Samsung or Sony phones. The sound quality is replaced by a cheap DSP... It is larger than same priced Samsung phone, and a small drop will kill the phone. I had Samsung, Nokia, Sony, and Motorola phones for past 10 years or so. By far this is the most fragile phone. I like the flip phones. If you want a flip phone with good reliability and features, GET the SAMSUNG phone...... I am very supprised that Motorola does not offer any blue tooth phone either. They are behind in technology.
