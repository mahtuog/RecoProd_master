This transmitter is the worse I have ever use. But I have a feeling of living in the mountains(CO) also might have an effect on it too. The sound quality has static in every station I turn to. and it doesn't have a synchronizing button where u can hit for the thing to search your area for a better reception dial. The transmitter makers have no vision....I an very disappointed and wasting almost 40 dollars for something like this in this economy.
