I bought the Jabra set to use with my Nokia 5160 phone. As far as I could tell, the sound quality was acceptable, but there are two things to keep in mind:1) The plastic ear inserts not only would not fit comfortably in my ear (one hurt because it was too big, the next size down wouldn't stay in my ear). Further, the plastic inserts kept falling off the speaker!2) There are no helpful instructions to help you figure out which of the inserts are for the right and which for the left ear. You have to experiment. There isn't even instruction on how to insert them in your ear properly.
