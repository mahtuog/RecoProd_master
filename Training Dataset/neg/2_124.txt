I am now in the process of ordering my third one of these, which is a testament to how much I like them. This case is really sleek looking and I love the fact that it automatically puts the BlackBerry into sleep mode. My first one lasted almost a year before the swivel clip broke off. My second one was ordered April 28, and here it is June 27 and the clip already broke. I told my brother about this excellent holster and he is already on his third one in 6 months.I love the functionality and style of this holster, but it seems the quality is not there in the way the clip attaches to the case. I suggest ordering at least two so you have a backup when the first one breaks.
