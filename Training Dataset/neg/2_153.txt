People who haven't used this phone can't understand why I dislike it so much because it is supposed to be so "cool". I bought it because it was one of the only Verizon phones that seemed likely to work with my Macintosh and iSync to transfer contacts over Bluetooth. While I had mixed success in that regard there is lots of other things about this phone to not recommend it.As for the physical form; the screen is an absolute blank outdoors in any kind of sunlight, the speaker phone key on the side is easy to accidently activate and I was constantly broadcasting my calls to everybody until I learned to be more careful, the same thing with the voice menu key on the other side, and the center select button on the 4-way navigation key is very difficult to push for anybody with fingers larger than Barbie (I had some success using my fingernails until I trimmed them).The user interface is horrible and I wonder if anybody actually tests these things; it can play music and take pictures but still has only one lousy field for the contact name (forget about sorting by last name or trying to keep track of a contact by their company name), all contacts get assigned speed dials and they must be moved, not deleted (very tedious to organize and so I only did it for the first 10 or so speed dials), you don't know for sure what speed dial number you are calling until the call has been initiated (unlike my old phone that would display the contact before making the call; I know they are speed dials but I don't always remember which number I assigned), it takes several key presses to activate "vibrate only" (as opposed to one convenient key press on my old phone), get used to the "get it now menu" and the "mobile web" because most of the navigation keys manage to take you there (there is only one assignable navigation key press and it can't be "recent calls", something I used a lot on my old, uncool phone) , backing out of menus is inconsistent (sometimes it is a soft key, sometimes the clear key, sometimes the end key), assignments made for speed dial or custom ringtones don't always seem to stick (for instance, the speed dial number seems to work as assigned but the "contacts" listing shows a different speed dial), and the "iTap" predictive text entry mode is a joke (producing nothing but esperanto for my simple messages). That is enough for now but I could go on.I was able to transfer my contacts to the phone using iSync but I did not try anything with the calendar. Besides the name limitation mentioned above, only "mobile", "home" and "work" numbers are recognized (in addition to email and fax). A subsequent sync overwrote all my speed dial assignments. Given the difficulties with that feature (see above) I don't think I will do that again soon.The voice quality and reception are good but using this phone is frustrating.
