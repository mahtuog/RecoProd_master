I can't think of anything to gush about with this phone. Usually I like Nokia's but have been disappointed in this one.The sound dips up and down while listening to a caller.The moving display on the front screen annoys me to no end and is difficult to read. It is a large screen on the front, yet only 10% of it is utilized. The time and number of missed calls etc moves up and down the screen. Why?My only hope is that perhaps if I feel like reading the manual this can be customized.And the battery....it is CONSTANTLY beeping at me because it needs to be recharged. It is ridiculous how poor the battery life is!Basically, this is just a generic phone to me. I am struggling to find reasons that I like this phone over others. I can't think of a feature that makes it stand out above the rest.
