I bought this phone in January of 2003. Since then I've had nothing but troubles with this phone.First of all, some technical shortcomings with the phone:1. Phonebook - You cannot perform a search on phonebook... scrolling tends to be very annoying.2. Ringer - NOT loud enough. I've missed numerous calls because of this reason. Ring tones are very low quality compared to Samsung S105.3. Software - Very slow to respond to button sometime.4. Screen - Not so good resolution. Camera attachment is just there to lure you in.5. Antenna - FREQUENT dropped calls from low signal...
