I bought this product as a new item.It is obviously not new, it was actually in much worse shape the my original battery that is over a year old...However, it charges ok and I haven't had any problems with the battery holding a decent charge level.I am not dissatisfied enough to return the battery, but I paid for a "New" Item and was given one that has seen extensive use, the contacts had visible wear, the green covering on the battery was ripped, the battery had scratches acrossed the surface like it had been thrown in a box with metal objects and sat there for a while...
