I have been looking for this adapter for some time now and found it at Amazon.com. The price is great, arrived before schedule, in new condition but did not work in my car. Everything fit properly but it would not charge my phone - I did not notice an illuminated LED which would indicate power input. In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though. I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it.Maybe once I insert it into another vehicle, it may work. For now, this is it.
