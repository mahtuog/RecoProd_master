Having such long standby and talk times are nice, but it doesn't make up for the low comfort. Thank goodness it comes with two ear pieces as one broke when I tried to put it on the device. Perhaps the company knew this and put two in for that very reason. The device is so large that the poorly designed ear piece does not hold it to your ear well.
