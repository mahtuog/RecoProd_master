I specifically clicked on the "new" battery to purchase. I received the 1st battery and it was dead. Called the company without hesitation they said they would send out another. Waited another 5 days and when the next battery came in it was dead as well! I then thought it must have been the phone - I bought a new phone and took that new battery to test in my old phone. You guessed it - Worked fine! So because these guys sent out 2 bad batteries I ended up buying a new phone. Now I have 2 good phones and 1 good battery. I would recommend NOT buying a battery from this company.
