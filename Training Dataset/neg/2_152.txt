I was hoping to use this as both a phone and as a MP3 player on my commute to and from work. While I like the design and functioning of the phone, I am very disappointed with it as a media device. I just destroyed a recently purchased 1gig Micro SD Card trying to remove it from the V3 slot. There is no way to get my music collection to and from my computer other than transfering this type card between my PC and the V3. The design and location of the Micro SD slot on the V3 is just awful. Any tool which can get a grip the card in the V3 to help remove it can also destroy the card.
