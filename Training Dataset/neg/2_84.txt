I owned this leather pouch holder for my Treo 650 for a full 2 months before the pouch fell apart completely, rendering it useless. The pouch is two separate components glued: the first part is the pouch itself, and the second part is the belt clip. After being happy with my product for 2 months, it spontaneously (not gradually) came apart where the belt clip is inserted into the pouch. A person walking behind me pointed out that my pouch and phone were on the floor; I looked down at my belt to see that the belt clip was still there. This is a great, space-saving way to store the phone, and I can't say that other pouches have the same defect, but the specific pouch that I purchased was of very poor quality, and almost resulted in me losing the very sensitive information contained on my Treo.
