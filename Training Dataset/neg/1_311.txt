I still have a tape player in my car, so I was very happy to get this product, in order to listen to my ipod. Unfortunately, the cassette adapter never worked! The cassette kept getting spit out. We tried over and over, hitting the prog button, turning it on in different order, hitting the rewind button, etc... It never worked, and I was very disappointed.The charger on the other hand did work, but my intention was to use the cassette adapter.
