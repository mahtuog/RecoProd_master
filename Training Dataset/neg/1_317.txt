I purchased this cassette adapter in order to listen to music from my ipod in my car. I have to turn the volume on the ipod up all the way, and the volume on the stereo up higher than I usually do, to get any sound. Even then, the sound will suddenly go out for no reason. This is junk. At least the car charger is usable, and the only reason I won't complain about not being able to rate this zero stars.
