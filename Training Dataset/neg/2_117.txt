I just received my headset and bluetooth 1.2 adapter. I am warning all who buy this with plans to use it with a computer. It will only do stereo music when the microphone is disabled. Making the features work with a computer are to say the least "very glitchy". If you enable the microphone you will only get poor quality 22khz phone type sound (very muffled and indistict). When it comes to pairing, you cannot pair it to your computer and use the microphone and also pair it to your cell phone, it is either or. The computer takes the place of the cell phone. It does however work extremely well with the included headset adaptor. It is really cool. If you pair it with your cellphone and the use the adaptor you will recieve a beep in your ear when a call is incoming. You can also listen to stereo music from you computer (if you mess around long enough). It also has incredible range. Anyway dont buy this for multiple uses. It is only for IPOD + Cell phone, thats it. Getting it to work on a computer is a incredible pain.
