Bought this cell phone as a replacement for my year old (and bulky) Nokia 3650. I like its compact size. I can live with most of its feature (or lack of). Yet its signal reception compared side by side with Nokia3650 and MotoroalV300 is *poor*.The SE_t610 signal indicator fluctuates between 1-3 bars when left on a table at home. Both Nokia3650 and MotorolaV300 show steady max signal strength at the same spot, same time. My major concern is SE t610 drops call in the stairwell/elevators as it looses signal completely. Whereas Nokia3650's signal strength drops down to 2 bars, but never drops an ongoing call.Compared to Nokia 3650/MotV300, the camera on SE t610 is a joke. The battery life (talk time &amp; standby time) are overly exaggerated in the specs. Also the battery charging indicator needs some work. Does not go off after phone is connected to charger for more than 12 hrs. I miss the nearly unlimited memory of Nokia 3650 (via SD). If size &amp; price were not a concern, I would pick a Nokia6600 or another Nokia3650 over SE t610. Would give it a 2.5 stars.
