had a bad experience getting the product from box wave. I had been looking forward to receiving the product, but am really dissappointed with the product. Is very poorly built and also very heavy. The usb port is placed or manufactured incorrectly so you have to tilt and push the charging cable in. The space bar does not press (click) as the other keys, which is also poorly built. I am also experiencing sync issues. If you press a key once sometimes it stays pressed and you get multiple letters of the same key which could be a fault in the key or sync issue. Over all, its a waste of money
