I bought this so called extended battery for longer stanby time with my phone . Boy was I disappointed! This battery is supposed to be a Nokia but there is No way it is!!This piece of garbage NEVER EVER held a charge more than 2 days! My old used battery I already had in my phone held a charge for at least 4 days over this "Extended battery!Do yourself a Huge favor and buy a replacement battery from a cellphone dealer and NOT from Amazon .com.These batteries are worthless junk and are almost like A Cheap Knock off !!!Buyer be very aware !!I only wish Amazon had a slot for NO STARS !!
