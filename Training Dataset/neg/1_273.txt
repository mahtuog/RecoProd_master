I have had the V3m for about a year. Sorry I bought it from Verizon. Can't wait until my contract is up. Same complaint as other reviews - disabled multimedia features. In addition, I like to carry it in my pocket - without the case. That's why I bought a thin phone - no bulge in pocket. But when you take the phone out of your pocket, sometimes the protruding buttons on the side activate the speakerphone or change the answer mode. A real pain. The buttons should be recessed.
