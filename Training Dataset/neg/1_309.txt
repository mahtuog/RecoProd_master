The Nokia 900 mAh NiMN Extended Vibrating Battery is anything but extended unless you are counting the time you will have it in a charger trying to keep it charged. I have had mine 41 days and am already having trouble keeping it charged. My phone is on about 10 hours per day with minimal talk time, Usually less than 30 mins. per day.
