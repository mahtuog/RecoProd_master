I purchased this item based on the generally positive reviews off Amazon, but found that it didn't work very well at all in my 2003 Carolla. I tried quite a few different station settings - including ones well away from real FM stations to get away from any possible interference. I could never get a setting that produced a decent sound quality.I also tried this in our 2005 Sienna thinking the results might be different - no luck.I tried different devices, including my smartphone (Droid Eris) and an iPod Shuffle.Amazon processed the return perfectly, even though I no longer had the original packaging.
