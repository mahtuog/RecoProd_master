I bought the T610 predominantly due to the 'free' deal on amazon, and secondly hoping Sony's quality would speak for itself. (I am a Nokia person, and had to put in a lot of thought to choose a phone that wasnt a Nokia).The phone finally arrived, quite decent to use, though i'd still rate Nokia's software to be more user friendly than Sony's. There were certain functions which i had to hit quiet a few keys to get to, when simple thoughtful additions in the software would have made using the phone a little more pleasurable. Talking about software, the reason i call this phone unreliable is 'coz, the darn thing freezes !!!U dont want ur communication device to crash on u.The display is great (one of the best), got great bluetooth capability, (especially with the Jabra Headset, which is useful, and looks cool), and a camera (which i've no need for).Great features, but dependability?? Its something akin to 'The surgery was successful, but the patient died' kindof a thing.and as luck would have it, the crashes became more frequent after i crossed the 30 day period of purchase from amazon. so i cant return it, and the only option i have, is to either repair it, or get a refurbished one from T-Mobile.but i've asked a few friends of mine who have purchased this very model, and who dont have a problem with it.if you dont mind the risk of gettin a faulty phone and if you dont mind the odd crashing of your phone, either while dialling a number, or while accessing the menu, and you dont mind slipping the cover out, removing the battery, and sometimes removing the SIM card,and putting 'em all back on, then you might find the phone great, else dont even touch it with a barge pole.
