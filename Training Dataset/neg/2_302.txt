Had one of these for a little over a year before the male 3.5mm plug started showing signs of a loose connection... and that was pretty much the end of that. After a few trips getting distracted jiggling the confounded wire to get the connection reestablished I gave up and threw the thing out. Not really the value for money I had hoped for, but unless you end up with a lemon like mine, it's a very decent product that does what it claims to do.
