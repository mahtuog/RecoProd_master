I have never purchased this product before. I think that it would be well worth your paying a little more for a better ear-bud. Only had for a few weeks and it stopped working. Also while it was on it blocked outgoing calls. If the bud was on after I made call,it dropped the call. The company is sending me another one,But next time I will spend a little more and get something different.
