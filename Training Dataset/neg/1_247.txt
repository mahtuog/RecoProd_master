I have no idea whether the product is any good, because I never received it. It took Webtreo several days to respond when I emailed them that the battery had not arrived by the end of the scheduled delivery period. They did say they would ship another battery. That second shipment never arrived. The first one did, finally, a couple of weeks later (I know it was the first one because of an ID number on the shipping label supplied by Webtreo after my original order). However, it was the wrong battery. The shipping list in the package had the right battery listed, but the battery did not fit my phone and information on the battery itself identified it as a different battery. Webtreo never responded to my email about sending the wrong battery. Amazon, however, did refund my money.
