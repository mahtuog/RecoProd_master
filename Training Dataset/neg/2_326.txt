I've now used this on two long car trips up and down the East Coast, and my recommendation is that you only buy this if you are absolutely desperate to use your iPod in your car, and there are literally no alternative ways to use your car's audio equipment to accomplish that. The sound (whether in an urban area or way out in the sticks) is noisy, distorted, and compressed, even when there are no local interfering stations. Loud music is crackly, quiet music is inaudible.
