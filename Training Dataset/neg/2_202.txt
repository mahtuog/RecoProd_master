I don't like this thing at all. It's painful to wear -- the speaker is like a big round hard knob which doesn't squeeze well into my un-knoblike ear. Maybe if they made the speaker have a more comfortable shape it would work well, but it kills me right now. I also spend forever trying to get it on. At any rate, I prefer the Ericsson hands-free where it's just a soft earpiece you can just stick in your ear without any fumbling.
