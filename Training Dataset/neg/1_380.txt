I could not wait to order this product. It looked great, had good technical writeups and reviews. When I did receive the headset I was very disappointed. I have a Nokia 8260 and the Body Globe 2.5 mm jack does not properly fit. The volume is so low that conversations are impossible. I already use the headset Nokia includes with the 8260 and it works very well. I was truely hoping for a more versitile and stylish headset. Instead I got a lemon with poor quality fit and performance.
