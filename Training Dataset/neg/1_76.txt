This case is not worth the money. The first problem was with the screw that hold the belt clip would not stay in the case. I glued that in place. Then the clip would not hold onto the case. Then the belt clip broke. The last thing was that slide that holds the Palm in the case broke. I would not recommend this case to anyone and would like to warn anyone that might want to try it. Look elsewhere!!!
