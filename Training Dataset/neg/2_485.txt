Like a couple of the previous reviewers, the clip on my original case broke within a month or two of normal use too. Luckily I was sitting on the train when it snapped rather than walking down the street, so no damage was done to the BlackBerry.The case works fine otherwise, but now it's carried in my coat pocket or in my messenger bag. I wouldn't buy another one of this design now that I see that the clip seems to be a common weakness.
