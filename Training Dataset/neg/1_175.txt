Before owning this phone I had had very good luck with Nokia phones, outside of dropping things on them and jumping into rivers with them in my pocket. I've had this phone just over 4 months and I hate it.I never used any extras or downloaded anything, so this is from the perspective of someone who ordered a phone from AT&T; and made calls and texted and took maybe 5 photos in 4 months:1. It's ugly. No style at all. I'm pretty practical for a twenty-something girl, but I feel like an old woman carrying this thing around.2. That neat-o button that opens it up? That was cool for about a week before the random openings got annoying. The camera button is obnoxious as well, unless you like inner-pocket photos.3. The screen gets filthy and it's so hard to clean out all the corners.4. Reception was not great. I live in the East Bay, CA and I've gotten a steady 2-3 bars at best. My last Nokia got great reception even in the Santa Cruz Mountains.5. Battery life is terrible. I don't talk that much, but I've had to charge it almost every day.6. It started out glitchy and just got worse. I had some problems when it was low on battery or just charged, but they seemed to clear up. Until now. 4 months and it won't stay on. That's unheard of! I'm not going to bother getting it fixed, and I'm not sure I'm going to buy another Nokia phone.
