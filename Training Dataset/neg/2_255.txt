I bought the charger, along with 2 spare batteries. The charger is simple, and easy to understand, good since there was no instruction sheet. It can be used in a car with the standard charge cord. However it will not fit anything larger than the 900ma battery that comes with the startac phone. Not nearly what I expected.
