This is an Amazon scam! The clip is not for the V60 or V60i phones. There is no way you can mount your phone on the clip.The box claims the clip is for the L7082, L7089 and 120 phones.So Amazon gets your money, you get a usless clip that would cost you more to return, than it cost to buy. Nice little scam.I wonder do they ever read these reviews. I wish I had, I took them at their word.
