I can only speak about Cincinnati, Ohio where the reception driving around is shockingly bad, 4 bars to 1 bar in a second, or even 3 to 0 bars isn't exactly working for me. I can look down a the phone and get 3 bars then put the phone up to my ear and get NO reception. I have version RS1 of the software and I have heard getting it upgraded will help, we'll see. Old Nokia is the same area worked fine.Rest the of the functionality is awesome, I'm just praying I can impove the reception.
