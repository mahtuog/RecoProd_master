cracked body twice and reception for both was problematic at best.crack on the body is one thing because it still works...the call button after 6 months broke, this was on the replacement and they don't replace warrantee replacement item. ear gel piece come off and gets lost easy. too heavy and uncomfortable compared to whats out there. you can hear fine...but it's mic or transmission is very noisy and full of static. I recommend the g2.what a waste of my hard earned money!!!
