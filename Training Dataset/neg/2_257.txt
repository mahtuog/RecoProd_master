I have a Plantronics M175 handsfree unit and the sound quality on it was just incredible. It even has a mute function, which is handy when on conference calls. Still, it is an over the ear type device, thus at times, it just doesn't feel comfortable, though it seems to stay on my ear just fine. The need for comfort prompted me to buy the Jabra. The comfort on the Jabra is outstanding. The comfort alone kept me happy for a couple of weeks, but eventually, I went back to my Plantronics M175. The reason,.... sound quality! The Jabra tends to have a tunnel, echo like sound, especially when in the car during rush hour, (a time when you need the hands free unit most). The inability to even listen to some of my voice mails with the Jabra device at times prompted me to try the Plantronics M175 once again. The Plantronics device is crystal clear. I wish it was as comfortable as the Jabra, but when I break it down, I need to hear and understand first on my phone, comfort is secondary.
