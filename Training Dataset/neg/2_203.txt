I bought this item because of it's looks and also because I have several Body Glove items. BUT, the earpiece do not fit right in my ear, it constantly drops out, the so called button to answer/end calls won't work on my Motorola Vulcan. The only thing I think it's OK is in the sound subject, I can clearly hear and they can clearly hear me.
