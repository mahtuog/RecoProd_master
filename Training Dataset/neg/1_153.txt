I did not do a scientific study, but I don't think the new battery that I received holds more or longer charge than my worn out 3 1/2 year old battery. When I got the battery it looked a bit beat. I called and they assured me that it is new. The person said that the batteries ship bulk in a bag and they get beat up. I'm not thrilled with the performance. I am skeptical and will not do it again. Cannot recommend it.
