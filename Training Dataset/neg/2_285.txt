Take the advice no one offered me. Don't.This phone was recalled by Cingular (although they insist that it was recalled by Motorola, which Motorola denies) three weeks before I bought it. They sold me a recalled phone and required me to sign up for 2 years of service.Two months later, I was told it was recalled and they offered to send me another (refurbished) phone. I told them I wanted to be credited for the phone cost which they refused. So they sent me another cell phone (V600). The new one is missing part of its front cover casing.I called Cingular and they said the only choice was to to send another phone, cancel the service ($200) or buy a new phone for whatever I pay out of pocket.This is unacceptable. If you buy this phone, don't go with Cingular.The only reason that the phone is a 2 and not a 1 is that you can actually make telephone calls on it. It does work for that purpose.
