I've loved Body Glove products since the late 80's (and I even own a Body Glove PDA case), but a little piece of neoprene does not a Body Glove product make. The one thing I do like about it is the fact you can wrap it around your ear when you aren't talking, and (like most similar products) it is very uncomfortable when inserted in your ear.After using the product occasionally for about 2 months, the speaker part of the headset simply came out of the housing. I tried 3 or 4 times to put it back in and get it to stay, but it kept popping out. After wrestling with it for a few days, the speaker finally quit working. I went to the incredibly weak Body Glove web site and sent them an e-mail asking about warranty, etc, but I never got a response. Figures.If I buy a .... product, I expect to use it longer than a few months. And, if I have a product that I have problems with, I at the very least expect a response from the manufacturer.Body Glove suckered me for [what I paid]. Never again.
