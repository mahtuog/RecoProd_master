I bought a new SCH8500 and it's fallen out of this holster at least 4 times in the past 2 months! Sure it seems to lock in quite nicely, but as soon as you nudge into something, the phone falls to the ground! My phone is now broken because of this and I'm waiting to recieve a replacement; If they'll even send me a replacement! You can bet I'll buy full leather phone protector when/if I get my new phone back. Do yourself a big fat favor and get a holser that protects the entire phone. All you need to do is drop the phone just once and it's all over...!
