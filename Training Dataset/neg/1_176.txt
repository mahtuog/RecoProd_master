This is the worst phone I've ever owned. After several months the paint has begun to chip off. The voice quality is fair at best. The battery life is terrible. Occasionally the mike stops working and the battery needs to be removed to reset the phone. When the phone is powered off, a number of settings (like the default messaging center) disappear and must be re-added.I will be replacing this phone soon and it won't be with another Nokia.
