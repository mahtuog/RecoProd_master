-I've had this phone for about one year. I've hated it since week one.-It's a bit too small (which I suppose some might like)-I get dropped calls all the time (Cingular)(I never had a problem with that on my OLD Nokia)-the volume can never be turned up enough-the ear piece is worthless-the buttons on the side are a pain because they get pushed and it changes it to silent mode etc.There was a recall on the orginal antenna. I had mine replace with the "upgrade" and noticed no difference with reception.Even though I got this phone for free from Cingular I feel like I was ripped off. I spoke with an employee at a Cingular store and he agreed with me that it is a horrible phone. It makes me wonder why Cingular would put thier name on a horrible phone.....oh yeah, they don't care about thier customers.
