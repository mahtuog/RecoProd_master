I have a T-mobile service in Miami, but I used it all over the east coast. The reception is pretty bad everywhere, a lot of noise, the sound is not clear also I have lot of dropped calls. When I called customer service they say we cannot guarantee service in all the areas, even in those painted as covered in the national coverage map. In some places I had no signal whatsoever but my friend who has the same service with a Nokia phone had three bars. In addition to that the preloaded games are boring like the "colorbug" and T-mobile doesn't have downloadable games for this phone. The camera is really bad, low resolution, no zoom and useless with poor light. The internal memory is small and you have to erase pictures all the time. If you have big fingers just forget it, it will be a nightmare to dial. The screen is pretty clear and bright, but that's it ...
