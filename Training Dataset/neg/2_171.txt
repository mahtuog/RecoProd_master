this is my second logitech set. my 1st was a mobile freedom which its ear loop broke after 6 months. logitech replaced it with this one 12/06. now 2 weeks prior to one year the ear loop snapped off of this one. POOR design which outweighs the otherwise very reasonable functionality of the device.called logitech and they are refunding my money, which is ok as i do not want another one!
