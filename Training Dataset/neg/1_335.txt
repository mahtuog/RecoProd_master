I've been a Palm fanatic for over 10 years. I've always been an early adopter and bought the latest gadget when it first came out. I agree with many of these reviewers that the Treo 600 was a breakthrough product and has great functionality, etc. But it is completely unreliable. I'm currently on my 3rd 600. Each one died a hideous death after about 6 months. First the normal phone speaker died. So Handspring replaced it for free. Six months later the monster buzzing in my ear made using the phone impossible (in addition it had a nasty problem of doing a hard reset all on its own about once a week - often when I was traveling.) So again handspring replaced it. About 4 months into my 3rd device the monster screeching buzzing returned. This time when I called for a new one I was informed by Palm that, "We don't replace phones for free any more. It will cost you $200 to get a replacement." So basically Palm's business model is: we sell you a product that consistenly doesn't work and then we demand that you pay us as much to replace it (with another one that doesn't work) as you would have to spend to get a blackberry. It's unbelieveable. So I thought I'd suck it up and buy the 650 (even though two different friends bought it and both had already swapped it out for the same unreliability). But Palm told me to get a 650 would cost me $700 ! I said, "Wait a minute, Handspring used to give me the new phone each time at a discount if I'd send my old one back." But I was informed that Palm doesn't reward loyalty in any way anymore. What a joke.So I wrote a letter to the CEO of Palm to complain. That was 5 months ago. No response or acknowledgement. What a disappointing company - in every aspect of it.I now use a Motorola Razor. Palm is a joke. No serious business person can rely on the Palm products or the company any more. Shame.
