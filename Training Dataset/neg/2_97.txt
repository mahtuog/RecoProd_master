I got a BT200 (appears to be nearly the same as the BT250) 15 months ago. It worked well and I liked it a lot despite annoying background clicking and short battery life. Now, after just over a year, its battery often won't last a day of standby let alone conversations. Jabra support says they have no spare parts or service and offered me a 20% discount on a new one. In other words, beware that this is a disposable product! I also have a BT-110, which uses a AAA cell that has much longer life and can be removed for recharge and/or replacement.
