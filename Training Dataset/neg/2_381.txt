I returned the headset. The casing is cheaply put together. With the headset on and the phone (Samsung SGH-a707) stationary I cannot walk more than 5 feet away without hearing much objectionable static. Talk time is ok. I purchased the Plantronics Voyager 510. This one is so much better,it's a difference between day and night. I can walk approximately 25 feet away, down the hall and into another room and still hear very well. I hear only a slight amount of static after I reach the far side of the room near a window.Don't buy the BT350, it's worth the extra cash to purchase the Voyager 510. I like the Voyager 510 better than the Motorola H500 too. I'll try and review the 510 soon.
