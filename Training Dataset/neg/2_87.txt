Battery came with no initial charging instructions or installation details. Installed the battery anyway and initially charged until cell phone indicated a full charge. Have used it for 3 weeks and find that the battery quickly shows that it has lost one half of its charge. Then it holds onto the second half of the charge pretty well.
