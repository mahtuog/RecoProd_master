I've had two of these. Both sounded and worked well for a few months. then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second. When this happens, you're perfectly operating earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery. While it's perfmance was good before the break, the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of "memory titanum" or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste (battery contains lithium I bet) Skip by this one if you're smart. I've been had twice.
