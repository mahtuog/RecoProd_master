I had this phone for about 3 days and the flash light froze. I had to take the battery off to fix this. Only for it to freeze again after trying the flashlight for yet a second time. It automatically deleted a couple of my contacts. I took it back & let Verizon replace it with the same model only for the second model to not recieve all of my text msges & text pics. When I used blue tooth or a regular headphone my callers were unable to hear me. The camera is aweful. I understand that this is a phone good for durability & the bells & whistles aren't suppose to be great but the basics should at least work. I exchanged it for the chocolate LG 8550. So far so good.
