...even if they pay me... for the simple fact that I can't download my photos from this phone (V3m) using my USB cable or Bluetooth without addl software I have to pay for! The manufacturer must be really hurting for money to be milking its unsuspecting victims (like myself) this way. May they go out of business.Addendum: It's not Verizon; it's not Sprint (my carrier, the worst); it's Motorola who came up with such an evil design.
