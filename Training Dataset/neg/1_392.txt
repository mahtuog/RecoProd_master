This phone should be less then free people should pay you to walk around with this phone. I have owned this phone less then 2 months and I take really good care of it considering, I wipe the screen off every time I'm done useing it I clean it each day, I even clean the lint out of my pocket before I put it in there but still for some reason lint and dust and hairs get under the screen in mine and my brothers and thats not the only problem I spend about 5 minutes each night just trying to get the phone to charge because the charger doesent clip in right or the phone just says unable to charge even of the phone hasent been charged for 2 days. This phone looks good on line and sounds like a great deal with the camera attachment but let me tell you its not. Take my advice and dont buy this phone it is a HUGE waist of money.
