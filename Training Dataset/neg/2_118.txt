GOOD:The unit produces good (maybe even above average) sound for most lay people. Pairing with the analog adapter was easy; and, pairing with laptop, desktop, and cell phone were very straightforward.BAD:The design of the headset unit is rather small. The (muted silvery) parts of the headset that connect the top part to the ear "cups" (speakers) are very cheap. The top (black) part is rather stiff.UGLY:If you have a wide or big head, you will need to spread the headset a lot everytime you put it on. When you do that, the muted silvery part will break sooner than later. It will break either around the area where it connects to the top (black) part or the other side where it connects to the ear "cup" units.BOTTOM LINE:If you have small head, this is most likely be a very good bluetooth stereo headsets for you. Otherwise, be very careful when putting them on your head and expect them to break.
