when i first got this phone i was very excited. but then the phone started to act up. sometimes when i am talking it would just cut me off. the reception is not really good. the ring tones are too soft and the vibration feature is really soft. i often miss my calls. the free camera phone is just a con to get you to get the phone. the camera does not have a good resolution. so all in all dont get this phone, it will be a big disappointment.
