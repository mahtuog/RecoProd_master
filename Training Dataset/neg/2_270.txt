I've had the earbud for several months now. The sound quality is excellent - better than my handset. However, the foam cover for the earpiece fell off the first day, and the design doesn't have any mechanism to hold it in place in your ear. Because of this, it keeps falling out of my ear while I'm driving, which makes it even more distracting than holding the handset!
