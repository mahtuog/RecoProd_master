I bought this one from Radioshack. I could pair the Bluetooth with Nokia 6682 phone, the connection was established only once. After that no connection was established. Nokia customer support informed me that this Bluetooth is not compatible with Nokia 6682. Tried with other phones, but no connection. I am going to return this.
