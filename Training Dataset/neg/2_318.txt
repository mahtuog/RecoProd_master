In all fairness, I read other reviews before ordering this product and I had my doubts that it would work well in a big city with a crowded FM radio dial.Nonetheless, I thought I'd give this model a try because, unlike other similar units, it can be tuned to any FM frequency. As promised, it was also easy to tune and set up the three preset channels.I tried, unsuccessfully, to find a frequency that was far enough away from another station to get a quiet signal. Then I tried again. And again. I had no luck so I sent it back.
