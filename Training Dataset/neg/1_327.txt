Avoid this product at all costs!! I used this headset for only 2 days before giving it the heave-ho. When you first put it on, it does not feel all that uncomfortable...however, after 30 to 45 minutes of use, your ear feels like it is in a vice! Plus, the reception is fine when sitting in a car, however if you stand up it gets crackly and is extremely hard to hear. I repeat: Avoid this product at all costs!!
