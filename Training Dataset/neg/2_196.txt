I found that this clip, after only a few months, stopped holding the phone very well. Then, after about 6 months, the piece that attached to my phone RIPPED a section off of the back of my phone. Fortunately, the phone was still under the original manufacturer's one-year warranty, but I have been using a standard case ever since.
