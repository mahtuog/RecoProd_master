I had a Jabra EarSet for my old Nokia 5160 and it worked BEAUTIFULLY! I upgraded my phone to the 8260 and purchased the &quot;compatible&quot; Jabra. The phone recognized that a headset was connected, but I could only hear extremely faint sound coming from the earpiece (yes, the volume was turned up all the way). Went back to the store to try more of the same Jabra units with no luck. I'm stuck with the Nokia factory headset which sounds fine, but nobody can hear me talk...
