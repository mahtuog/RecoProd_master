I bought the silver version of this case and was very disapointed. The belt clip is of such cheap construction that the case would easily fall off my belt. On the bright side, it protected my Palm from breaking, but I would have preferred it not to fall in the first place. The case also had a tendency to flip open while on my belt, causing the whole thing to pivot on its flimsy clip. I don't recommend this product.
