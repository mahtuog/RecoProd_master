I would advise anyone thinking of purchasing this phone to choose another one! I have had this phone for a little over six months and have already had to have a replacement phone sent to me. This phone has horrible reception and will drop calls in the middle of a conversation. The color on this phone is nothing to brag about and the camera does not take clear pictures at all. For anyone thinking of buying this phone don't waste your money. I would suggest going with a samsung. They seem to get the best reception and have the best color. Don't waste your money on this phone, you'll be disappointed. I know I am!
