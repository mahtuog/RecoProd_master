Please note this comes without an AC adapter. So all you're getting is a plastic thing to sit on your desk. The stooooopid clock isn't even powered by the AC adapter (yours, came with the phone or purchased separately.) I acually use mine just to hold the end of my charger on my desk at work. When I want to charge my phone, I unplug the AC connection from the back and plug it straight into my phone. Saves me from digging around under my desk at least.You're better off just buying an extra AC adapter and some tape.
