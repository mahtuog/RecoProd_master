I have changed to GSM and selected the V3xx phone as the Motoroal V60 was the best phone I have ever owned. The Razr V3xx has some short commings that anyone considering it should know about. First of all you have to have the phone really centered on your ear to hear it at its best 1/4 inch makes a difference. The front screen is too small to read incoming call numbers, so it is useless for caller ID. Both inside and external screens are hard to read in bright sunlight. The srceens are great in reduced light or indoors. The start call(green) and end call(red) buttons are right next to buttons that start the AT&T browser or CV both of which will cost you if you press one by mistake and cancel as quickly as posible, you learn to look at the buttons you are pressing, not a good idea if you are driving. I have not been able to find a good blue tooth device to use while driving. I have purchased two units with built in speakers and three ear piece devices. The best is the Motorola H700 (I bought it from Amazon to avoid fake look alikes and the $99.00 asked by AT&T). The H700 is scratchy but usable in a car. The quality and volume of the blue tooth on any of the devices I have tried is about equal to the built in speaker. The last issue with the phone is battery life, if I am lucky I get two days charge on a battery. I probably place or receive four to five short calls a day. Sometimes I run out of battery on the second day, so now I just plug the phone in each night. My old phones Nokias, Motorolas, and Panasonics (all digital not GSM) lasted between one or two weeks on a charge. I guess I'll have to adjust to the new technology!
