I was hoping to use this to play my ipod in the car on road trips. The sound quality is terrible, and there is static on just about every channel. I live directly between Milwaukee and Chicago, so there are very few stations that have dead air. This transmitter is not strong enough to block all of the interference from local radio stations. This product may work well when traveling through rural areas, but that has yet to be tested. Do not purchase this unit if you live in an area with tons of radio stations.
