After reading all of the reviews for the FM transmitters I decided I would go the cassette adapter way. It worked for about 2 songs then the player kept spitting it out. One of the reasons that I bought it was the power adapter that came with it. Maybe someone will get smart and make one of these things that actually WORKS!!!
