Ordered this to replace a Griffin transmitter that I have had for years. This one pales in comparison. While I understand that all transmitters have some static when listening through them, this one is worse than I expected. Not only do you have to deal with the poor signal, the volume level of this one is also very poor. There are several songs on my ipod that I literally have to turn up the volume on both the ipod and the radio to even hear. Would not recommend. My Griffin transmitter is falling apart and I still have better sound using it. I guess I'll use it until it quits completely and then try again.
