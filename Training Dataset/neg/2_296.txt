Bought this to give as a gift. Was a little surprised to find just the unit in a ziplock bag. No instructions, no quick guide, no packing material or warranty card.Just and FYI that from this seller it looks far from "new"Since it was already open I tried it to see if it was DOAIt does work just about as well as any other FM transmitter. Static between songs but while playing it sounds fine.
