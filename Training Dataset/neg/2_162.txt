This phone is definitely a beginner phone. If you just want this phone simply for phone calls, then this phone is for you. But if you want a phone that has a good quality camera, takes videos, and etc. this phone is DEFINTELY not for you. This phone doesn't even have the video feature on it.Oh and the battery life absolutely sucks!The only good thing about this phone is the cool lighting features. THAT'S IT.
