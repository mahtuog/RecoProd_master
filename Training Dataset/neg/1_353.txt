I bought the phone from verizon and had to replace it 3 times in the first 4 months. Phone kept restarting and disconnecting when I inserted a hands free ear/mic. Design for hand free is bad...never fits well. Sound quality is bad.I would say you get what you pay for. The PDA is nice and all, and web feature is great if you don't mind a $120+ bill each month. Still for $150 the phone part is terrible. Now I'm stuck with it for another 18 months. UGHBuyers beware!
