Phone has excellent features but has bad reception. Just after a month (right after the store exchange policy expired) the charger is not working. Some loose connection may be. I read somewhere else that others are having similar issues. It is frustating to have your cellphone breakdown because of the charger issue. How can I recommend this to anyone with this kind of issues ?
