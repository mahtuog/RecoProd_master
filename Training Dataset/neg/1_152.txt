Battery was purchased from OEM Planet. The first battery delivered was clearly used. The contacts showed excessive wear(worse than the original battery that is 3+ years old). The green sticker/label/wrapper was severely damaged and scatched through. Worse yet, the white indicator(for water exposure) had a red strip. I contacted the seller for a replacement, indicating that I wanted a new battery as advertised, and not a used one like they had provided. The replacement battery was delivered promptly. However, it too was used, but not damaged. My experience is very similar to that of other reviewers. $5 buys a used battery, not a new one. I will not be purchasing anything from this seller again.
