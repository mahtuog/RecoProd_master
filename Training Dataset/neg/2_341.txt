My two sons have this phone. The size and camera are great, durability is NOT. On one phone the back button stopped working. On the other phone the center button fell off (just like another review). The T-mobile store says buttons that fall off are not covered under warrantee. We are already buying a different phone at full price to replace the one with the buttons that fell off.
