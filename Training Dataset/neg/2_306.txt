I bought this product about 4 months ago. It died. I don't know what happened. I just went to plug it in one day a couple weeks ago and it wouldn't even light up. I also feel that the other comments were a little misleading...it only has 3 stations that it can use and if you live near the city it's not a great idea. I live in Charlotte and it's a pain. It's easy to use but I wouldn't recommend it. I usually had to try all the stations every time I would travel an hour to three hours away.
