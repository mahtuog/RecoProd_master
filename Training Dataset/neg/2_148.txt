Admittedly, I don't use a tenth of the bells and whistles that this phone is supposed to have, I just want a phone. In that category, the Razor V3M falls horribly short.When the battery life in my LG4600 crept down to about half what it once was, I finally had an excuse to get a better looking, and hopefully better performing phone. The sales lady convinced me that the Razor was the best out there, so that's what I got. I was horrified to find that the brand new Razor battery lasted less than the half-strength LG that I had just gotten rid of!!!Pro's:1) It's a great looking phone. Of course, now EVERYONE has one in some form or another, so even that's not much of a pro now.2) Great big display! Very nice.Con's:1) MUCH worse reception than most phones I've had, just about everywhere I go.2) The battery life.3) Tinny-sounding speaker.4) Unlike just about every phone out there, you have to take it out of the plastic belt-clippy thing to open it for use, or charge it.5) Not loud enough. I sometimes have to put it on 'speaker phone', just to hear what's being said.6) Terribly user-unfriendly and counter-intuitive navigation menu. (8 selections to just initiate a text message?!? PLEASE!) In fairness, that may just be Verizon, not the V3M.7) Impossible to tuck between your shoulder and ear. In fact, even when holding, you have to 'fold' the phone a little bit to get it close enough to both your mouth and ear. Not the least bit ergonomic.8) WIMPY vibrate, even with full battery charge.
