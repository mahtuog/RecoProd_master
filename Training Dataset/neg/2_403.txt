I've had this phone since February 2004, and have had nothing but problems with it. Dropped calls, spotty network, and VERY poor customer service. I have called T-Mobile on numerous occasions and it would seem that the only job of the reps is to pacify you and tell you that the service will get better. I will not, however, resubscribe with T-Mobile next year, if they do not clean up their act. I was told that I would get reception at my house. I have to walk 4 blocks away for one bar of signal. Little things like that add up. The camera, games, etc. are useless without good solid signal service, and this is where T-Mobile fails miserably.
