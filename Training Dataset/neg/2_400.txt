If you want a phone that looks good, then this one is for you. But if you're looking for a good phone, this is not the one. The phone locks up every now and then. When it does, I have to turn it off, then on again to use. Also, the joystick is too sensitive, hard to click 1 and get it do what you want it to do.Volume is also too low, can't hardly hear it ring.2 stars for the look only.
