When I got this phone, it seemed to have everything I wanted: camera, color screen, pretty pictures, t-zones compatible. But the more I got to use it, the more I came to despise this phone. It does not get good reception, and I even had a T-mobile worker agree with me that the reception is not too good. I have dropped more calls than I can count on this phone. It will send people straight to voicemail and not give me a voicemail notification until hours later. (Not very convienient when people are trying to reach you.) I have been trying to exchange phones at T-mobile for a long time but most of the customer service representatives deny that the phone has reception problems. Overall, if you live in an area with absolutely no valleys, big buildings, or anything with a roof, than this phone is great, but if you ever want to be able to use a cell phone inside a building or in a valley or while you are driving, then DO NOT get this phone. It is not worth the cost. The camera does not even take very clear pictures. If you want a phone that works, sacrifice the fun gadgets and abilities and buy a nice, simple nokia or samsung.
