I have to say these earbuds do fit very snuggly in the ear and great a great feeling. Unfortunately I bought them for the jawbone 2. After about 3 weeks of using the same earbud on the jawbone, the earbud would not stay on the jawbone. It would constantly slip off the jawbone earphone and would not stay attached.I now use the jawbone without an earbud. It doesn't fit as nicely, but it stays in my ear now.
