Hi,I upgraded to this phone last fall and I have been disappointed ever since. You have to set the alarm every night and the commands are extremely slow. Ending a call is slow. Typing in a phone number to call is slow. Texting is slow. If you patient then this phone is for you. I paid for this phone and the phone I had previously was free and much better. I suggest going into the Tmobile store and scroll through the features to make sure everything you want is there.I also had to get a replacement phone because the circle which navigates through the menu fell off. The clerk stated that this problem in not uncommon.
