I bought this clip because I wanted to carry my cellular on my belt.The basic design is good - the phone is held in a convinient position on my belt and didnt bother me when I sat down in work or in a car.There are two main problems previous reviewers mentioned which caused me to stop using it completely.The first one is that holding mechanism isnt strong enough, and the phone would sometimes get released when I sat down - nearly lost the phone in meeting rooms and company taxis a couple of times.The other one is that it once broke my phone's back panel, which forced me to take the phone to a service center. Lockily I bought both the phone and the clip from Nokia, so they fixed it without charge but I still had to spend a couple of hours travelling to the service center and waiting in line for the fix.I resorted to using a leather carrying case - not ideal but doesnt break the phone either.As for the guy who wrote the oldest review, I guess he carries his phone in a briefcase and relies on hearing the phone's ring rather than on vibrations.
