Some quick commentsFirst dont get the Verizon car charger. Mine had a tag on the cord which indicated that it must be disconnected after the phone is charged. Maybe to prevent battery overcharging? Useless for me on long trips! Verizon charger was over $30.00. At Staples a Motorola charge which can be left connected was less than $16.00.I use a Palm Pilot alot and can dial via Bluetooth phone numbers on other cell phones. This does not work on V3m. Also simple sending of contact information did not work. A quick look for software to connect V3m to Outlook or the Palm for daily schedules resulted in nothing. To connect the V3m to PC via USB appears to require a $30.00 package from Verizon.The V3m does NOT have a standard wired hands free connector on the phone. I did get a "converter" which I have not tested but even if it does the phone does not support both the charger and wired hands free at the same time. The converter may only be for headphones but even if it works with headphones it another thing to carry around or lose.Voice dialing does work great and speaker phone is good.
