The phone had always had small problems. Sometimes the screen would freeze for several seconds. Recently, some calls would have heavy static and I have to call the other person back. Then last night, the screen just turned blank. It only shows a white screen with no graphics. I can still receive calls and dial numbers, but without the screen I can't access my phone book nor see who's calling. T-Mobile refused to exchange the phone because they said the warranty has expired. Now I have to buy a new phone.
