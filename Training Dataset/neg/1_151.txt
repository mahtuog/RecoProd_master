Given the variance in reviews, at best, I'd say this is an unreliable product. (I saw the mixed reviews before ordering, but figured "they couldn't be that bad.")First of all, the battery was NOT a BB battery -- not as pictured nor made in Japan (it was plain silver and made in China).The battery I received wouldn't hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. I sent an e-mail complaint; was told that sometimes a given battery won't be up to snuff; and they would exchange. The second battery lasted a little longer but not even 24 hours. I gave up. I had made a bad bet. I just didn't want to bother with them any more. I used it for a couple of months -- having to charge it once or twice a day. It declined steadily and finally flat-lined this week. Ironically, I'm now using my old battery which seems brilliant compared to my recent experiences.Maybe you'll get lucky, but the odds are against you.
