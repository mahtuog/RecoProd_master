I'm on my second one of these, because the click-tab on the first one broke. It's not more than a month later, and this one has broken the same way. Six dollars may not be much money, but it should buy me a higher quality product than this. And I can't get the clip separately from the holster. If I could get them separately, I would just buy ten of the clips at two bucks a pop, because it isn't the holster that keeps breaking!
