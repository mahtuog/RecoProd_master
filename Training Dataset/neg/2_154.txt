This is a good phone that was messed up by Verizon.You can't transfer your files from the phone to your computer. Verizon wants you to pay them for the privelage and use their network to transfer.If you were to ever call them and ask them about it they are GREAT at Passing the buck.Even though you may have bought the phone in a verizon store from verizon they say it is motorolla's fault that you can't transfer your pictures. Despite the fact that their version of the RAZR is the only version that is crippled in this way.Furthermore they have made it so that you can't change the red colors that permeate the interface. This is just adding insult to injury. If you want to add your own custom ringtones, there are two ways, the easiest of course is to pay verizon money to send it to your phone. Other ways are hacks that sometimes work and sometimes don't. Also you can't make the phone vibrate and ring at the same time. My ancient nokia, that I had in 2000 did this and so has every other phone I've owned since. I don't even understand why Verizon would disable this.There is one feature I'm am not totally happy with, that is not Verizons fault(as far as I know, but I wouldn't be surprised). The camera takes the crappy pictures you would expect from a phone. Unless your hands are shaky like mine. In that case it will take pictures even crappier than what you would expect from a phone.The phone itself is slick. It's thin, the ergonomics are better than any other. Verizons voice calling features are great. The fact that the address book interface is clunky doesn't matter one bit when you can just tell your phone who to call. You can whip it out and dial all with one hand. Then have it on the speaker phone while you are waiting for someone to pick up. As a phone it's hard to beat, but these days I think we are allowed to expect more.The saddest part is that it's my favorite phone from the company with the best network, you really can't win.
