We purchased this case for our Samsung A640 phone with Sprint service and it is too tight for the pone. The directions say "your case may seem snug when you first try to insert your phone, this is normal and it is important for you not to force the phone into the case but rather insert it gradually. The case will quickly stretch to conform to the phone's shape." We followed these directions and it is still too tight. When the phone is inserted, the case depresses the photo button, turning on this function and disallowing the use of the phone for talking. Also, my wife liked this case because of the stylish stitching, well, it started to come undone immediately. We are sending this product back today.
