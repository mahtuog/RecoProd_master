I should preface my review by saying I am new to Samsung phones and the only thing I care about is clarity of the incoming sound. I had been using the Nokia 5160 with the garden variety in-ear bud for 3 years with very happy results -- the incoming sound was comparable to having a landline phone receiver next to my ear. By contrast, the Samsung OEM bud used with ny new Samsung R225 phone is a disappointment. There is a huge difference in sound quality between holding the phone next to my ear versus listening through the earbud. The latter sounds as if I had water in my ears -- muffled, faint -- I can barely hear while I'm driving, which is 75% of the time that I use my phone, so this is a real problem. Will explore the (new?) Plantonics M205 option and hope it's better...
