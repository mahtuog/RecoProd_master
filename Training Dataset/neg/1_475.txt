I thought this phone case was a good idea. *At first*. The leather's thick enough to be protective (I've dropped it) and the clip is the best I've seen. But my phone is only for emergencies. And even so, it's really become a pain.The front flap closes with velcro over the face & has to be folded (& secured) back to talk, even while using it hands-free. I don't think it's worth even [price].
