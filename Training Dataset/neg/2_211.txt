The design was flawed at best. It fell apart within 45 days, the ear piece came apart, the wiring became exposed at the earpiece, and the sound was lost soon after. The sound was mediocre. The only positive thing about it was the fact that it didn't fall off your ear. It really was a waste of my $$$$.
