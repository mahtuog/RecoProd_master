Keys not designed for adult human use... volume buttons on side where a person usually holds the phone will set off rings/noises usually at an awkward time.LG also knows there is a problem with the antenna on most of these phones. They started replacing the stock antenna with a better("red") antenna, but they didn't get to a lot of them, especially the "free" ones they give you at Cingular.You have to call "Warranty Service" to get the new "red" antenna to get service without mega cutoffs. --If you live in an apartment; DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PHONE! -- And good luck on a speedy finding of where the earphone/mike handless plug is..
