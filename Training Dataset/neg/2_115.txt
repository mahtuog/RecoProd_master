I own several Platronics Headsets (DSP400 / DSP500) to talk on Skype and I own a Macbook.I bough this headset to use with Skype, so I don't need to be wired to the computer while talking (since I talk a lot on Skype). I tried them with MacOSX 10.4.x (Tiger) and now with 10.5.x (Leopard) since I read the quality of bluetooth headsets would be better on Leopard.Since I own several plantronics headsets I was expecting a good quality. I have to confess that I hate the quality. The sound quality is bad and lagged. It drives me nuts to talk for a long time with them because of the lag and because I have to repeat myself several times (because the other person doesn't understand properly).
