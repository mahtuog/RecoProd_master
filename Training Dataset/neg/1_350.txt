The treo 600 has been nothing but problems for me. First after I bought the phone it took verizon a while to figure out how to turn it on...the store said they couldn't do it. Then the phone stopped working and would reset itself when I tried to use anything at all. After getting a new phone I got a 1000 dollar bill from verizon because they had signed me up for the wrong plan and the internet would stay on for 24 hours straight. After a few months the new phone is no longer working...it is now constantly reseting itself. I'm very frustated. Great idea combining phone and pda but get a different model and don't use verizon. By the way the camera is crap...0.3 megapixel...doesnt take any good pics that you can actually see.
