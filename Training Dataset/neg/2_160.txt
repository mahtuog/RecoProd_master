Palm Treo 700p ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen ProtectorThis product cannot support some of its selling points. Based on my experience over the past 6 months, I replaced it once on my Treo 700p because it did not fulfill the following claims: Dust-repelling, Fingerprint Free, Improves Handwriting Recognition. And the sensitivity of the touchscreen was inhibited by the screen. It does protect the Treo touchscreen from scratches and is completely washable and reusable. But application even with the supplied applicator does not easily flatten out the air bubbles when applying to the Treo. The screen is a dust magnet and natural oils from your fingers cannot easily be wiped off. So, once applied, the dust and fingerprints are visible to the naked eye. I expect much improvement over the next year if I am to purchase this again. Hence, I only give two out of 5 stars to the Boxwave anti-glare screen protector.
