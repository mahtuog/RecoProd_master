The cost is low ($10) and they sent it quickly. I charged the battery fully right after I received it. I didn't make any phone calls but it became low after only two days. It is worse than the one I intended to replace.For 10 dollars I don't even want to waste time to send it back. Just don't buy things from this place anymore.
