I was very disappointed with the earglove. It looked so cool with the interchangeable foam covers and all, but I just couldn't get it to work for me. The build quality left a lot to be desired, and after several attempts to fit it comfortably, it sort of came apart, although I managed to get it together again. Then I just couldn't get the earbud thing to fit in my ear; if I stuck it right in it was very painful, as it's not padded, and if I positioned it hovering outside my earhole, I could hardly hear a thing, especially when the car was moving. I had much better luck with a competitor earpiece which looped right around my ear, and had a broader speaker cover which sat outside my earhole and gave plenty of volume. Another irritating thing about the earglove was the mute button, which if your phone is not compatible cuts off the call instead.I don't want to be too harsh since I think with these ear-thingies its just a case of finding one which fits the shape and size of your ear best. Maybe the earglove would work well for you. Its just a shame you have to buy one to find out. Maybe a friend has one you could try for size first, because if it doesn't fit it will be useless.
