This product alone does NONE of the things listed in the descrption BY ITSELF. You must still buy other software to use it. When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things, which it doesn't do, they pointed out where it says "may require 3rd party software for various uses". I just didn't know that the definition of 'various' was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED.I would rate my experience with this seller as: DissapointingAt least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere.
