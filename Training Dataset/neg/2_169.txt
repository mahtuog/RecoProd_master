All I did was put my microSD in my phone and tried to play music. When you do this it puts the necessary folders on the card at which point if you put it in an SD adaptor and you have an SD slot on your computer or a reader you can put songs directly on the microSD without having to use an item like this. I have a Samsung a930 the only thing you have to make sure of is that your music files are .wma's.
