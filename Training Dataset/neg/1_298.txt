The phone is neat and comes with a lot of great features, but buyer beware-the warranty is basically non-existant. We had a problem with the keyboard and called for warranty service and they said that the warranty is invalid if there is any water damage. We explained that there was no water damage, it just stopped working. They asked us to check a "dot" sensor on the phone. If the dot is red, the warranty is invalid. We asked how the dot could be red when the phone (2 months old) never got wet, and their rep told us that rain, sweat or being exposed to humidity or condensation! An unscientific survy of razr uses at a soccer game found 4 of 5 with the dot turned red-and hense no warranty.So bottom line is, it is a good phone, as long as you don't sweat or live in a location where it rains or gets humid.
