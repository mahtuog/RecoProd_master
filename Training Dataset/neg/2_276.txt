I purchased this case new with my phone and alternate it, using the holster sometimes and the case at other times. The case is somewhat durable, but not real tough. Recently the stitching started to come out and the plastic which covers the keypad of the phone broke at the bottom. I am not real rough on my stuff and am only a mild cell phone user so I found this item disappointing. By comparison, the Nokia cases hold up much better. If you have a StarTac, skip this case and try a 3rd party brand - you will sepnd less and probably will get a better case.
