Unless you are a teenager with someone paying your bills, or looking to join a class-action lawsuit, this deal will be a nightmare. I bought 4 of these phones for family members and they are all going back.The RAZR is a crippled phone, now lacking key features that were built into it. Verizon claims it is BlueTooth capable, but that is misleading. It won't link to our computers. It was quite a frustration to discover that Verizon purposefully prevents that.Connecting it directly to a laptop, the USB cable is reduced to a battery charger. You are prohibited from transferring files either way. I take a lot of pictures. They recommended a 2GB storage card and installed it for me. Imagine my dismay when I discovered that it is impossible to transfer my image files to the computer by cable or BlueTooth. In order to get my images, I would have to pay Verizon 25 cents per image or $500 for a full card of images. No kidding.And if you want a non-idiotic ring tone, or anything else, you pay and pay and pay extra charges to Verizon. Go ahead and google "razr bluetooth" if you want to fully appreciate the horror Verizon has unleashed on its customers.Or save yourself the trouble and hair pullout, and find a better phone with a better company. The Verizon RAZR makes the iPhone look dirt cheap.
