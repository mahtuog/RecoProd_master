I have had this phone for a week and was about to take it back due to the bad sound quality when the glass window on the outside of it broke. True, I dropped it, but it's amazing that one drop could shatter the window. I looked up this phenomenom on the internet and have found several postings about how fragile the glass is. One person said that it cracked when they pulled it out of their pocket. I had my previous phone for 3 years (not a razr) and dropped it accidentally several times, it did not break once. This phone is not worth the hype. The sound quality is not great and it's much too fragile for real people.
