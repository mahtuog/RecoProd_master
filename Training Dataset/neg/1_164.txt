The product arrived quickly. I ordered this and the box wave Stylus/ink pen. My original review was 4 stars; however, in the last weeks of ownership, I've lost at least 1 black ring from each item! The small black lines you see are actually black really thin and cheap O rings. They make for a comfortable and stylish pen and mini; however, when they fall off and you lose them, it becomes an uncomfortable and ugly Stylus and min! I lost the first one of each before I even noticed the rings move easily! After being aware that I must use caution, I lost another. I'd like them to send me quiet a few spares for each item. But as it is, I can't give this product a good review. I would not order another box wave product knowing about the temporary rings!! It's upsetting!
