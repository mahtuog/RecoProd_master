Great concept, I've had a palm pda since the first palm pilot personal then professional then a 7 and then the i version for internet with palm.net. I love the palm apps calendar and contacts, but this phone that cost $500 started to give me problems right after the year warranty time period. (which just so happened to coinside with the Katrina catastrophe when our phones weren't working anyway due to service problems). The problem still continues with the same as the other reviewer mentions with this loud buzzing on the receiver side of the phone call. It's terrible and not usable this way. I'm afraid to send it for repair based on what another reviewer said that he got a refurbised model that was in worse shape than his and then after a few months had serious problems. The repaired phones are only warranted for 90 days, not long enough for these problems to show up. Palm should be ashamed of themselves for not providing better support for such expensive phones!!! I bought mine unlocked directly from Palm as well.
