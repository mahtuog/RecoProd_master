A genuinely good idea but the service and product built was just way below average. I preordered the item but I have to chase it a few times before the manufacturer ship it, needless to ship, arrived way after the original schedule delivery date. Then the USB connector was loose so I cannot charge it properly (I can understand there may be production glitches and that's life) but the really annoying part is the service, I contacted the manufacturer nearly a week ago and I am still waiting for their feedback, may be they forgot they are suppose to turn around within 48 hours. Anyway, I still have a defective unit sitting on my desk and I am still using the Apple onscreen virtual keyboard.... Not a great experience.
