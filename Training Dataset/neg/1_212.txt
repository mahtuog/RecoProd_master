I purchased this product and it was great for about a month. The other day I was getting out of my car and the clip broke off from my belt. The phone fell into the street and was destroyed by oncoming traffic. I'm out a $400.00 phone because of the cheap plastic used in this product. If your looking for durability look elsewhere.
