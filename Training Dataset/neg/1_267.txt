I wanted the Motorola RAZR for a while and I finally got one. Now, I just wish I had my old phone back. Here's why I don't like this phone:- buttons on the side are easy to accidentally push- the standard ringtones are terrible and you must pay for any new ones- the battery doesn't stay charged for more than a couple of days- frequently used functions are not very easily accessedOverall, I had high expectations for this phone. I thought I was getting this high tech, cool new device and it's not even as good as the simple three-year old phone I was using!
