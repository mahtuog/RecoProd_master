I bought this really cheap a year or so ago, and I guess I got what I paid for. The little part where you press the buttons to choose the station is super sensitive. Barely touch it and it switches to another station. It frequently slides down between my seat and the center console, where I have to fish it out and the station gets changed again. Sometimes there seems to be static on several stations that I go through. The display also gets super hot, even if you have the light turned down. When I can afford to buy a better transmitter (hopefully one that also charges), this one is going in the garbage.
