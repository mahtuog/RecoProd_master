This product, described as &quot;SAMSUNG car charger for SAMSUNG phones&quot;, is NOT a SAMSUNG product! It is a generic car charger.At first I thought they shipped the wrong product, but thenumber on the packaging (B00004W6N7) matches the ASIN numbershown in the description of the product.It would probably work fine, but in the past I've had problemswith the connectors on the generic chargers, so I'm notinterested in it. Will be returning it.
