I figured this product would be good considering monster is a solid company, however, every station that I was able to hear my music (Zune), there was static, even subtle static was enough to make it not worth the money. I got a cheaper Belkin product and it was much better, I found at least one station that gives basically no static. So just get that instead of this for 1/3rd the price. I live near a major city and that may have caused some of the static, but the Belkin gets me almost none so it must be the product.
