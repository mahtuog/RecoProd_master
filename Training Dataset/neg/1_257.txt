DO NOT BUY A CELL PHONE FROM AMAZON!!!I bought this phone on Dec 15th, they delayed my ship date from the one promised when I placed the order so I had to call them and change shipping to 2nd day so I can get it by Xmas. They charged me extra. Then after I received the phone I found out the pictures are terrible, it comes out blurry and washed out.I called Amazon to try to get them to upgrade my phone. I was willing to pay extra. I just get the run around. Amazon blames Verizon, Verizon says call Amazon, and so on.DO NOT BUY A CELL PHONE FROM AMAZON!
