I puchased this for the reason that; it hooked around your ear and, it had a small boom microphone which, I though would perform better than my Jabra earset. Unfortuately, I was wrong.Sound quality was pretty good but, in order to achieve that quality you have to get the earpiece firmly in your ear. This is where my pain came in! The hard earpiece had to be lodged in my ear in such a way that, after about five to ten minutes, I had to take it out because of discomfort. While I did use it I tested the microphone by leaving myself voice mail messages both at home and on my cell phone. The sound quality was poor. If I couldn't even understand the message I left myself, that's pretty poor.Overall, I could not recomend this for the reasons mentioned above. Save your money and, look elsewhere and, let me know if you find someting good!
