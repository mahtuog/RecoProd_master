The body of the unit crack around the bending earpiece area within a week or two that I have it. I send it back for warranty and it took them 4 weeks and with great hassel with their customer service before they sent out a replacement. Then when I receive the replacement unit and use it for a week, it cracked at the exact same place. I figure it is just poor design flaw. I use crazy glue and glue it back together and it hold but all my friend complain about the static and noise interfearance when I use it. It is not my phone because I use Nokia 6820 which is top of the line bluetooth capable phone in the market. Since I can not get my money back, I figure I have to buy something else.
