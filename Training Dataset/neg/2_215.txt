The Earglove is a cool looking hands free gadget, no doubt. The little neoprene dealies are purely aesthetic but I suppose style counts for something. And it is comfortable to wear, also giving you good audio quality on your end. People on the other end of the line tell me that it's hard for them to hear, however, making it pretty much worthless to me.
