This weirdly shaped earpiece is hard to put away, and I bought the device because I read on T1 that It was the best , with longest battery and clear sound. Well to my surprise the range on it is horrible. Pants pocket to my ear it would not work. And not to mention using it on my computer. If I was touching the laptop with the earpiece it would still sound terrible and with a lot of interference. Dont buy this its horrible!!! I exchanged the next day, for the logitech one.
