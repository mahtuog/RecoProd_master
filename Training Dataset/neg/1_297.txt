My boyfriend bought this phone for me from Amazon and it was the worst idea ever! First, when I got the phone it couldn't be activated due to technical problems (due to Amazon, not AT&T;). I called Amazon for assistance, and they forwarded me to their cell phone department who said 1) they didn't know what the problem was, 2) there was no one else that I could speak to, and 3) they would email (NOT call) me back. Amazon gave me the run-around for over two weeks. Finally, i took the phone into an AT&T; store. They informed me that is was most definitely a REFURBISHED phone. They also told me the reason there were so many problems activating the number is because the phone number BELONGED TO SOMEONE ELSE! I called Amazon to discuss the fact they had sent me a refurbished phone when I had bought a NEW phone, and they did not have an answer. The very nice customer service representative said that he would have someone email me back (because the cell phone specialty department did NOT make any calls). It's been two weeks and I still do not have an explanation as to why I was sent a refurbished phone or why I was assigned a number which was already assigned to someone else.DO NOT buy phones from Amazon. Although you pay less for the phone, it's not worth it!!! Just go it the store and deal directly with the cell phone company.
