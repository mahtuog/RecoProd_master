This phone has terrible reception. Forget what you hear from these people that say Sony Ericsson has a different type of signal indicator and all that crap. The simple fact is that this phone does not get a signal, or gets a weak signal, where some other phones like the V300 get a good signal. In addition, even when this phone has a signal, it still cuts in and out during calls.The microphone picks up a ton of background noise making it very difficult for people to hear you when you are anywhere with any noise in the background at all.The camera on my phone has a horizontal line going across the middle of the phone. This may be my particular phone. Besides that, the quality of the camera is very poor compared to other phones.The phone freezes up at random, requiring you to turn the phone off or take the battery out to get it to restart. T-Mobile suggested a master reset, which incidentally wipes out everything you have saved on the phone, including settings, contacts, appointments, pictures, etc. Not convenient. Anyway, it seems to have solved the problem for the most part, only hanging once since then.I would like to point out though that T-Mobile has very, very good customer service. I have called in several times, at different times of the day, and have never had to wait on hold for more than 30 seconds. With AT&amp;T, waiting 30 minutes to an hour is normal! And that's assuming the system doesn't hang up on you. Also, my girlfriend has the Motorola V300 which works very well on the network.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. Get the V300. You will thank me for it.
