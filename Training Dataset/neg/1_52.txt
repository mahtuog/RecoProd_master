I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc.
