Do not get this phone. I got it for free and it was cool at first but after a few days I got *dissapointed*. Sometimes when I dialed a number and hit the talk button, I put the phone to my ear and waited. Then I looked at the screen and the *useless* thing had gone to the main menu. Also the volume is *really* bad. You have to push the speaker into your ear really hard to hear somone on the other end.WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!
