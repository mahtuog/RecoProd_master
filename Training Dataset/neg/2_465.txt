I have had this phone for around 3 months so far. I really love the appearance of the phone but it is very diffacult to do some things on it. For example, it is hard to text message compared to other phones. You have to click the numbe rof the letter yiou want and then choose the lettrer and hten press ok for each letter instead of clicking or doubleclicking th emumber of the lette ryou want. Another thing was that it is perhaps too small... that i always would lose it in my purse. But the camera works ok, I might add the nokiA 3650 WORKS MUCH BETTER AND HAS A VIDEO SURVICE AS WELL..)My dughter has the Nokia 3650 and it has much better fixes and easier to text. It also takes pictures much clearer and has a better screen even thou it is big. I wished I had choosen that phone.
