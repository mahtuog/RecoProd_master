This phone looks nice and the size and weight is the only thing I like about this phone. I bought this phone 4 months ago and I regret buying it. The battery life sucks (had to charge everyday) and there is not much feature. Seems like Motorola pushed this model to promote VCast, not the phone!Look for something else if you are planning on getting a new phone.Goodluck
