Pros: Easy to set up, seems like decent battery life.Cons: Clumsy, some keys hard to push, you lose all the auto-correct and shortcuts that come with the on-screen keyboard. Sucks to type with it on a screen that doesn't rotate horizontally (Facebook).Honestly, Boxwave should've made this thing feel and operate like a Blackberry keyboard since I suspect that's the majority of people who are going to buy this.Once the thing is paired, you lose the iPhone's autocorrect feature as well as time saving shortcuts like the auto capitalize after a period and double space to leave a period. Something Blackberry users are accustomed to.I would say, if you're buying one of these because you don't want to learn how to use a touch-screen keyboard, the time you would spend learning how to cope with this thing would be better spent actually learning how to use the touch-screen keyboard. As a long-time Blackberry user, my biggest fear was moving to a touch screen and losing a physical keyboard. But now that I've used an iPhone and grown accustomed to typing on it.. I don't think I can ever go back to a Blackberry.
