This Nokia is about as simple and basic a telephone gets nowadays.You get good sound quality and easy texting in a compact unit.The major drawback is very poor highlighting of menu icon selections.If you have activated many features, this cell will frustrate you.It's a crapshoot what you actually select. I had to buy 2X magnifying specs in order to utilize menu features.Also, the signal strength and battery power indicators can be very difficult to see - minor points considering AT&T; functionality (damnedgood) and rapid battery charge rate.The vibration indication for incoming calls is very effective, and ringtones can be adjusted easily.In regards to pricing, AT&T; sometimes will give this cell free for activating two years service. The highest price AT&T; ever charged for this Nokia is $9.99, in refurb condition.I've had my Nokia for half a year, and I appreciate it; it's not perfect, but it is useful. A phone should be a phone, not a portable entertainment system. Thanks to the magnifier specs, I don't have to squint at the screen anymore.
