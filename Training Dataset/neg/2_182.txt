I just got this phone a few days ago to replace my broken SonyEricsson Z520a. I'm attracted to this Samsung because of the thin form factor and pretty impressive spec.But the first time I used it, I was totally disappointed. My biggest complaint is the flat keypad. The keypad doesn't give you enough tactile feedback when you press it. And for some reasons some keys are harder to press than the others. This really annoys me since I text message a lot.Other than the keypad, this is a very nice phone. The screen is high resolution (320 x 240) and very bright. IMHO the user interface is not as intuitive as Sony Ericsson's.I tried Bluetooth on this phone and was able to transfer my phonebook from my laptop without a hitch.But for me, the keypad is the killer. That's the reason I rated it 2 stars. This phone is going back to Amazon for sure.
