I've had it for a few months now and find that the interior rivets rub a spot on the back of the cell phone. The phone can also be turned on by itself or perform other actions because the holster side of the opening flap has a seam that transcends the key pad buttons, including the hot keys and when sitting in a car the seat belt buckle pushes on the phone case and the seam causes the phone to sometimes turn on and perform some random programs. Dangerous for contact lists etc. I have a few pictures of the inside of the phone case also.Phone can also be propelled out of the case with little force if the correct angle of bump is directed on the antenna while walking. The flap will pop open.I need to get another case.
