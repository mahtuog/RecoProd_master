I have used this headset for about 4 months. It is adequate in the sense that you can hear on it, and people can hear you, but that's about it. My specific problems with this unit are 1) If the bud it not turned in your ear such that the speaker points directly down your ear canal, the volume of the caller is much reduced. I wound up driving around holding the unit pointed into my ear just to get sufficient volume, thus defeating the &quot;hands-free&quot; aspect of the device. 2) Its hard exterior become painfully uncomfortable after 10 minutes or so of talking and I had to often switch ears mid-conversation. 3) People I talked to often complained about being able to hear me while driving, even with all windows up and the radio off. 4) after these four months, the speaker just died on me, and I'll have to buy another one!I will be trying the over-the-ear-with-a-boom-mic or the all-in-ear models next. Avoid this one if you can.
