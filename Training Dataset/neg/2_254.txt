The charger I got from Amazon.com came without a single word of documentation. The manual for my phone helps a little. The charger comes with snap-in templates to fit different phones (I guess), but not a word of explanation about which one to use, or what the others might be for. Maddening. I just played Garanimals(tm) until I had a good fit, but why was that up to me to figure out? At these prices, write some instructions!The item that I received is different from both the one in the manual and the one pictured on Amazon.com even as I write this review, so any docs about what the lights mean would be useless anyway.Kudos to the guy who figured out that there's a status light for data sync activity -- go to the head of the class! :-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine. The &quot;drop in&quot; slot for the phone is more like &quot;pin the tail on the donkey&quot;, though, same as with my Nextel phone. All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.
