It's a very convient head-set that works very well, WHEN it works. I agree with some of the posts that the design is not robust. It falls apart within a month of use. I've had to replace mine several times now. The wire that connects to the microphone is poorly designed so that if you put enough strain on it, which is not much, you will start having static, noice, and complete cut-off of sound issues. If you choose to buy this product, buy several as a back up if you can affort it or just buy other aftermarket products that are cheaper.
