First of all, they sent me the wrong model. Second, while it sounded great, it only produced sound out of ONE speaker. I know it wasn't my car stereo or MP3 player, because they work fine with everything else. I asked to exchange the item. I had to pay to ship it back even though it was obviously defective and then, though I sent it to "EXCHANGES" and was told it would be exchanged, it wasn't. It was refunded and they told me to reorder another one. Thanks...but, I'll try a different brand. What a bunch of morons! Can't even get the right item in the package, charge $10 to ship something that weight about 2 ounces, and they don't understand what "exchange" means. Sad.
