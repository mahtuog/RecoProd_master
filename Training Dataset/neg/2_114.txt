The literature leads you to believe it works with the treo 755p. NOT UNLESS you use the bluetooth adapter. It seems to connect since both phone and the earphones indicate connected but it does not respond when music is played. To make it work you have to use the blue tooth adapter (which you shouldn't have to do since the phone is bluetooth). In addition, the stereo jack with the adapter does not fit in the small earplug jack outlet in the phone. You have to purchase a jack adapter also. Very disappointing.
