I had this headset for 3 days. Dropped it from waist level and now it doesn't work. I could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but I would have had more enjoyment out of it. This unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. If you have larger hands, like I do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. The sound was mediocre at best, and everyone I spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. Not recommended. Move on to another.
