At first the Pulsar 590A looks and sounds very good once you get over the hefty price tag. Was unable to pair with my brandnew integrated bluetooth computer. Customer Service claims they only deal with pairing with phones and not computers and the headset is NOT suppose to be compatable with computers. mmmm makes you think. If i wanted a mobile headset only, why would i go stereo?So still using the adapter and not my integrated bluetooth, even after hours and hours of research, and reinstallations, setting changes etc.After two months i noticed small cracks in the plastic cover on the LH. Then all hell breaks lose. Small pieces start falling out and the cover just disintegrates. Today the same happened to the RH cover. The pressure from the black headband on the covers are to big for the plastic to hold out. Major design flaw imo.After talking to Customer service again, the resolve is that i send the complete unit back to the supplier in the States at my cost, and have him replace it, at which time i need to pay customs again not knowing if the replacement will last longer that three months. At which time the unit price will be in excess of $400. I think i will rather buy a new cordless top of the line headset from a different manufacturer.
