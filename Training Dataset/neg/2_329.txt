VERIZON USERS BEWARE! Due to no fault of this seller (product did not come in retail box, but came in tact), Verizon users will only be able to back up their address book (inadequately at that), not transfer photos or ringtones. After many calls (the seller, verizon and motorola) I found out that Verizon puts a block on the phones so that you have to use THEIR services and motorola software will NOT work completely.
