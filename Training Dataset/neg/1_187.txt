Pros- they look great- handy wired dongle and charging stand- very good sound quality- comfortable and lightCons- distracting blue light flashing (it's bluetooth I get it already)- slight sound lag- every once in a while signal drops out replaced by grating static sound (can be fixed by pressing the link button, but is jarring none the less).- after a few weeks the charging connector pin on the headphones became faulty and stopped taking a charge. was still able to get a charge by placing headphones at a *very specific* angle connected to the portable charging cable. annoying to say the least, but workable.- after about two months (ten minutes ago) the plastic on the headphones cracked and fell apart leaving the left earphone dangling by a wire. I was very careful with these comparatively expensive headphones and had never dropped them.It's a shame, initially it seemed close to perfect.Be aware that Plantronics does not offer refunds, only replacements.
