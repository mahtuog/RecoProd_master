This headset is worthless. I too am constantly having people that I'm talking to complaining about the large amount of noise generated by this device. I cannot hear it but they can.Incoming sound is not bad, clear and fairly loud. The outgoing sound is so bad that sometimes the person on the other end of the call can't understand what you are saying which makes this product virtually unusable.Don't waste your money on this thing.
