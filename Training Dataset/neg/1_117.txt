My wife got this phone to replace her Samsung X427m that was stolen. I suggested she stick with the Samsung but she wanted something different. She got this phone off of Ebay for $50.Even at $50 this phone is not worth the money. The phone's problem is that the reception absolutely sucks! I am lucky to get 2 bars in my own house using this phone!! Whenever she calls me on my cell or landline phone, the call drops after 5 minutes or so. Its not my cell phone because my SE T637 always has at least 4 bars where ever I go. As a matter of fact, I was just on the phone with her and the call dropped for the 3rd time in 10 minutes. I have been trying to call her back, but the call won't go through.This phone reminds me of the nightmares of MetroPCS' pitiful coverage. But the problem here is not Cingular service, its the phone! I can't believe Cingular would allow their name to be branded on this piece of garbage.LG sucks! I will never purchase another LG phone again.I will be getting my wife the Samsung X427m which we had no problems with and NO dropped calls!the only good thing about this phone is the bright screen, but what good is that if the phone doesnt work worth a crap to begin with??NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!
