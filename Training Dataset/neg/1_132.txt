After I ordered I received a case that was scratched with a piece snapped off. It looked used. Unfortunately since the piece was snapped the case was unusable.I called the company and they told me they never sent used stuff but would send me a replacement at no charge.The replacement didn't fit the phone... (but just barely--it was the right shape and almost the right size) after 25 minutes of attempting to get the case to fit, I got it on. Then I realized I'd left all these finger prints on the phone trying to get the case on. I wanted to take off the case and clean it but it would not come off.Finally I got it off and it snapped in the process... I tried repairing with superglue but that made part of the case opaque. Ultimately I threw the whole thing in the trash can.This case is a waste of your money. I strongly advise against buying it.
