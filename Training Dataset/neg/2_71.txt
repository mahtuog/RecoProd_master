This was a nice case at first. It looks nice and protects what it covers. After two weeks the case broke where it clips together, as if the phone was too big for the case. It's the right model for it and everything. I noticed under the case started to slightly scratch the phone as well. I was disapointed but then again, it wasn't an expensive loss. I'm now looking for a better case.
