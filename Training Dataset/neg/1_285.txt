Purchased this for use with the New LG Chocolate phone. Downloaded the updates needed to use it with the new phone. So far have been unable to do anything with it. Will continue to try, but would not recommend it based on my experience. Easier to have the service provider do the phonebook transfers and pay to download the ringtones.
