I bought this phone about fifteen months ago and was initially very pleased. Lots of features, really cool sounding stereo sound from the stereo speakers. But.... I use my cell phone average 1500 minutes a month. The slide does not hold up. The phone sections separated on one side, I got a sim card failure message on the phone screen and the off button would not turn the phone off. Removed the battery and it is now dead on my desk, will not turn on with battery reinstalled. $300 for fifteen months is a little pricey.
