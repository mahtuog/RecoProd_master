My Startac was everything it could be so I blindly bough the T722i thinking it would be the same, what a waste. Its got the right hardware, but its the dumb things the software is missing that hurt. You can't sent address entries over the air like most other GSM phones. You can't select what type of clock you want (I find the cute analog clock to hard to read when its so small on only moderate resolution). You can't delete any of the pre-installed images (its my memory thank you). It has to little Java memory to be useful. The camera sucks. The clock is not displayed durring a call -- With such a huge screen and they don't even leave the clock on. The programers should be ashamed to have wasted the hardware. The RS232 camera is also a terrible afterthough.
