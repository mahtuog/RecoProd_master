Simple put, The Razr is one of worst & best phones I've ever purchased. I purchased one for me and one for my wife. For a point of reference, my first phone was a Motorola Analog Startac in 1995.I'll lay out the good and bad, and let you decide for yourself.GoodVoice recognition - works very well.Layout and size - Button layout is good and size if great.Screen - Good size and resolutionCamera - Works well if you can get past the Verizon bs to get the pictures off the camera.Audio Quality - Good and good reception.BadSlow - OMG! This phone is so slow. Agonizing slow. Hit menu and wait 3 to 4 seconds for it to come up. Yeah that's right, 4 seconds, I just timed it.Battery - If you plan on talking on this phone, then you need to charge every night. If you talk during the day, charge it when your not on it.Ring - No ring and vib. Only ring or vib.This phone has a lot going for it, but the speed of the menu functions makes all the bells and whistles a distraction.
