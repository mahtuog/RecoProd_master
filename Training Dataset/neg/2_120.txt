My initial impression was the sound quality was good but the workmanship was cheap. The cheapness was confirmed after about a month when the headphones stopped working and stopped taking a charge. Additionally, when speaking with Plantronics support I noticed a small crack on the union between the headband and the right earphone. Now, these headphones were never dropped and handled delicated since day one due to the noticably cheap quality.On the positive side Plantronics support seems first rate, the reason for the second star. Plantronics must be well aware of the problem because they went straight to processing a return. They are shipping me out a new unit in advance of me sending the old pair back. a much appreciated CS touch. hopfully the new batch has these issues fixed
