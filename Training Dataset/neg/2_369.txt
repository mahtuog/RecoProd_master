I personally think Plantronics Voyager 510 is still the best choice to go.I love my Plantronics Voyager 510, too bad I lost it.I bought this one because it seems like it is a new product.I dang made a wrong choice...Plantronics Voyager 510 felt so comfortable when put it on the ear, but this one just hurts my ear like hell!
