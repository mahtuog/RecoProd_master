I am currently on my third of these car chargers. I have had to return the previous two, with some difficulty, as they continue to stop working. I have not been tough on them at all, they simply stop charging, the light won't go on, or they simply won't work. I realize that there aren't many options, as Samsung has been clever enough to design a very unique plug and it is unlikely that other manufacturers will emerge, but it is a shame that this product is not as durable as the phones that it supports.
