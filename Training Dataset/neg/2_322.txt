I just got done playing with this in my car for the last hour. I don't know if it's my location (about 90 minutes north of NYC) or what, but, I just could not find a station that provided sound that satisfied me.The best sound I could get was equivelent to a average to poor radio station. Sound was distant and hollow. Not anywhere near a quality radio station sound.Let's put it this way, if I were to tune to a radio station that had the sound I was getting, it might hold my attention for a little while, but, certainly not a station I'd be willing to preset on my radio.This is being returned.
