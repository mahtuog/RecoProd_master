The phone is OK. BUT...it doesn't come with anything but a wall charger. If you want to load music onto it you have to buy a mini SD card and a data cable (sold seperatly) If you want to LISTEN to that music, you have to buy special earbuds that only fit this phone. (DUMB)I bought this phone for my 15 year old son. How many pairs of these Nokia specific earbuds am I going to have to buy?????Really a RIP OFF if you ask me....Keep looking! Don't get this one!!!!
