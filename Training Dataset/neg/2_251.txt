This &quot;Charging Stand&quot; requires a charger. Considering the price, it should come with one. I purchased this for use at the office, thinking I could then leave the charger that came with the phone at home. No such luck. Be prepared to spend another $30 for the charging unit if you are purchasing this as a replacement or additional unit.
