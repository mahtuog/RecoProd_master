First of all, it was a regular battery not at all the extra capacity as stated and second it stopped taking a charge after 4 months.The whole phone is now "outdated" after less than a year, soI'm stuck with a piece of landfill. Why should I buy anotherbattery...when I can get another phone for "free".
