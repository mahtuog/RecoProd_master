I have specific requirements and this phone fails for me. I'm not interested in the camera or how pretty it is. When I specified what I needed I asked for a triband phone with voice activated dialing that didn't weigh half a ton.Well it's light and it operates in most parts of the world but the voice operation has a complete mind of its own. The phone keeps operating under the voice password in the car whenever it hears any sounds with similar cadences but the actual dialing instruction commands are usually not recognised. The worst of both worlds! Trying to make a call in hands free mode in the car could kill you if you persevered after the phone has refused to put the call through.Many of the functions connected with the &quot;In Car&quot; profile just switch themselves on and off without reference to you and while the keyboard lock does unlock in the handsfree modes it fails to re-lock itself when the phone is placed back in a bag or pocket. So the first person in my &quot;Phonebook&quot; gets frequent back pocket calls!If Nokia did a decent voice activated phone, I'd be back with them like a shot. The Sony/Ericson partnership may yet bring forth a great phone but this isn't it and I'm unlikely to risk buying from them again.
