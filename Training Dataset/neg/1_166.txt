This merchant, AccessoryOne, is blatantly lying when they say this battery is "New." I just got my order today and the battery is obviously not new:1. It is not in a sealed package; just loose in a tiny plastic bag.2. The paint is scratched off of the edges.3. There are greasy fingerprints on it.4. The terminals are scratched from the phone it was previously in.If Amazon allows these unethical vendors to hawk their used and/or counterfeit products as new, the whole market place concept they've created is not credibility.
