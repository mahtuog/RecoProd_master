Unfortunately this item doesn't provide flawless quality through the radio. I can't seem to find a station that doesn't have any static. Not to mention, it's awkward to use. Unfortunately I stopped using this product after a week, and went back to burning CD's.Save up your money and buy a head-unit that has an auxillary input jack.
