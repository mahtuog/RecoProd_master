Real quickly as I'm on hold with T Mobile right now. I've owned this phone for 45 days and haven't used it much. Yesterday it began to freeze. I couldn't use the keypad to input numbers during a call, I couldn't turn it off, when I removed the battery to turn off the phone and then reinserted it, the screen asked for a password because it was locked. I never programmed that function, nor did I have a password but continually pushing buttons finally cured this problem.Now T-Mobile will send me out a refurbished phone on an exchange program. This will be interesting because I have a feeling they will just send me out a phone that someone else has returned for the same problem as mine.Not so happy with this phone because I don't need the bells and whistles, I was just looking for a good phone with good reception and Amazon had this on their best sellers list....
