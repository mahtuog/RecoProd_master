I have owned this phone for about 6 months and I hate it. The only good thing about it is the looks. Phone is not user friendly at all. You can not move quickly through functions, keypad is awkward, battery life is horrible, reception is horrible. Now the phone has completly stopped working. Only the on-off button works. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. This is the last time a motorola product has let me down. I'll never buy Motorola again! I'm geting an LG.
