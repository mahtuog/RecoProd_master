I purchased a Treo 600 when it first came out. That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650. I was on Cingular with both phones. Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had. I'll spare you the details since they've been documented well elsewhere. I will add that After my 4th phone dying on me, I decided to cancel my service with Cingular, which renders my locked phone a $400 paperweight. I've gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS. Palm was a good company once, now they have got their heads up their #&(&^$#(. Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running Windows now????
