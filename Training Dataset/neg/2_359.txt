This is the second Bluetooth headset I have owned, to replace a Motorola H700 that was awful. I am not happy with this headset. The range is TERRIBLE. I have to have the phone sitting on my shoulder to be able to hear properly. Even then, the person I am talking to has trouble hearing me. However, it does look nice and feel comfortable in my ear. Those are the only positive things about it.
