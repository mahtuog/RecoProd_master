this phone has great features only if you are not interested in hearing who you are talking to and don't want them to hear you clearly. the volume goes up to a level 5 and i need at least 2 more volume levels to hear most people. i'm 25 and not hard of hearing so you can see how this would be a problem. when i'm on the phone i have this weird look on my face b/c i'm trying to decipher what people are saying to me. do not get this phone unless you also want to purchase a whisper 2000 to go along with it.
