I want to be really fair, Krusell makes very high quality cases, but this phone is just a pain to make case for.This Krusell case fits very well, however, because the BB has microphone underneath the key pads the plastic cover on this case will make you sound very muffled and weak. This phone doesn't have a "microphone opening" like other phones, so the only way to expose the mic is not to have a case. I have received complaints from customers and coworkers that I sound horrible. The thickness of the case makes it very difficult to use the thumbwheel. Overall, this case will degrade the functionality of the phone.
