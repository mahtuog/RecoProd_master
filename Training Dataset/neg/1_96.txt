The car charger does not work unless you hold the phone a certain way, the ear piece lasted about 2 weeks if that...the on only thing that was worth anything was the case and I could have went to trade day and bought one for $5 and it would have been in any color I wanted. So really I paid $13 for a case. Maybe I just got a bad batch who knows.
