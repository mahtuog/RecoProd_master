Compare to the original BP-5L battery I have, the build quality for this battery is obviouslylower in many aspects. I cannot say for sure it's a counterfeit, but there are manydifferences between this and the original battery:- The circles around "+" and "-" are thinner.- The font of "NOKIA" is thinner.- The paint of words and symbols are much less clear.- The seam between the plastics are not well-glued.- In English it reads "MADE IN HUNGARY", but in French is reads "MADE IN CHINA"
