Like the rate plan, like the phone. Don't like the way that Amazon fulfilled the order, however. Evening of day #1: I placed the order. Day #2: Amazon runs a credit check (as all cellphone vendors do) and I'm approved; so my order status is changed from "not yet shipped" to "shipping soon." Later that day, Amazon send me an email to let me know that they've shipped my phones. Status changes from "shipping soon" to "shipped." Day #3: Amazon send me an email, advising me of my new phone numbers. Days #4, #5, #6, #7, #8: Still waiting. Day #9: Phones delivered. OK, so the phones actually arrived during the time period that Amazon said they would. So why am I complaining? Because on Day #3, they had Verizon assign phone numbers and activate the phones. So I had the "privilege" of paying for phone service on days #3-8 without having the phones in my possession. With a family plan of 4 phones, that was about $18, plus taxes and fees, straight from my pocket to Verizon's. Gee Amazon, thanks for the "favor" of activating the phones six days early for me.
