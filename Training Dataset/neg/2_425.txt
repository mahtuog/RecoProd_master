I was very enthusiastic about getting this phone because of the reviews, its look and the fact that it was, for all intents and purposes, free. It arrived and switching my number from Sprint was fairly easy, though required a few calls to T-Mobile to check on their progress.Navigating around the phone is fairly easy, and the display is great... indoors. Outdoors is another story entirely. The bluetooth functionality is pretty good, too, though when used with the Jabra headset, I can't get more than 10-15 feet away without losing the quality.Now for the downside: I live in NYC where the entire city is a wind tunnel. The bulk of my calling occurs when I'm walking on the street. This phone picks up all of the surrounding noise - car horns, sirens, and especially wind - often eliciting comments from people on the other end such as &quot;are you in a helicopter?&quot; I'm not sure if this is a setting that I can adjust or if it's just the way the phone is. Certainly, if it's the latter, I'm going to need to get another phone since the microphone sensitivity is simply unacceptable.
