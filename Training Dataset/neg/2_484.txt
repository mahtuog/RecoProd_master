Lovely leather in a comfortable case. Too bad the clip design is so bad. My original lasted 3 weeks. I bought a replacement and it lasted just 2 (and the clip broke in 2 different places!). Now I carry the case around in my pocket.If anyone has a suggestion for a holster that actually works (and puts the Blackberry to sleep), I'd love to hear it.
