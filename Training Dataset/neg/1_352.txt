I got this phone and put the money into it so that I could add some handy software and have an all-in-one piece. This was the most pathetic phone I have ever had. I replaced it a total of 5 times before I just made T-mobile send me a completely unrelated phone. I spent so much money to get so little. The phone with just lock up all of the time, would not get service randomly that was unrelated to the service provider, it would need to be reset daily and then would constantly have to be backed up in fear of losing information and having to do a hard reset. I do not recommend this phone for a toy for a baby, much less for a user who really wants to have some sort of function other than looking at the pretty buttons.
