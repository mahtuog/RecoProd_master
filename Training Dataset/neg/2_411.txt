Anyone new to this phone will not know that there are multiple firmware versions for the t610. Well since I cannot access that menu (the phone locks up) I cannot say which version I have. However I am having LOTS of problems, poor reception quality (supposed to be impreoved with firmware), calls are dropped when the screensaver kicks in (minute or so), and after taking pictures the phone locks up for... dunno I waited 30 mins before trying to turn it off and then it eventually reset.
