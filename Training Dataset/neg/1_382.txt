I bought one of these, and the sound was so terrible - both talking and hearing - that I sent it back. The replacement was just as bad, and over the course of the week, the whole thing fell to bits. It was completely unusable, and they wouldn't honour the warranty, saying I must have abused it. As much as I would have liked to, I was very careful. The plastic bits covering the electronics just fell off as I was wearing it.Also, in both cases, the ear thing was very difficult to set up for my ear and then to get on and off without screwing it up. If it isn't in just the right place, you can't hear.This is a REALLY bad product and a total waste of money. The idea is good, however. Perhaps a better company will make one that actually works.
