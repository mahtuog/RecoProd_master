Classic case (get it? case? har har) of 'you get what you pay for'.Dint expect much from this guy for the price, but figured it better than no case at all. I was pretty much on the money with that prediction. Not much protection from this guy. If youre looking for something rough and tough that will keep your phone alive and well for years to come, this is not your case.The case is thin and flimsy. Kind of scary to put on, and my fears were rewarded when the case finally tore trying to put the thing on for the 20th or so time (doesnt fit in an iPod cradle with the case on)My advice is to skip this case entirely and get a real case if you want one. This thing is like wrapping tape around your phone (until it tears and becomes entirely useless)
