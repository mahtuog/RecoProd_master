This phone seemed soooooo awesome out of the box! It looks bodacious! It feels like high quality. You turn it on and its easy to use, sounds good, and has a great speakerphone.But here are a couple problems I had with the phone...Poor reception! About 3 or 4 times in the first 2 weeks of owning this phone, my reception would cut out for hours at a time no matter where I was in town.ALARM PROBLEMS!!! I set an alarm for everyday when I wake up. Well I switched shifts so I disable the alarm on the phone... but it still wouldn't shut off!!! Every day it went off at the same time no matter how many times I deleted the alarm! and if the phone is locked it's very hard to shut the alarm off before you want to throw the phone against the wall.... Also it would activate the alarm about 50 times in the same moment, causing the device to freeze and no way to reset it, unless you take the battery out. WHICH CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING when you're trying to sleep in.I have read in online posts that this has happens to lots of S710 owners.Everything else is great! good wi-fi, calls, etc.
