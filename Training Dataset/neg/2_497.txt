I was excited to get what I heard was a great Bluetooth headset for my Motorola W385. With one phone call (in which I was stationary) the sound quality was slightly but distinctly poorer than what I am used to with my wired headset; at least the conversation didn't seem to suffer, so I thought this was okay. However, the second time I used the headset, this time on the road, the person I was speaking to complained that he could not hear me well and asked if I was using a different headset or something. This was simply unacceptable. Under the same conditions, using my trusty old wired Plantronics M214C Headset, I never have any complaints and people tell me I sound best / clearest when I use it (the old, wired, Plantronics M214C Headset). To me, Bluetooth isn't worth it unless/until it can match or surpass a wired headset in reliable sound quality. It's that simple. I don't like getting tangled in the wires, and I've been frustrated with headset jacks that suffer from wear (and now I have to contend with an adapter to mini-USB in addition) but, ultimately, it's about hearing the other person on the line and having them be able to hear you, too.
