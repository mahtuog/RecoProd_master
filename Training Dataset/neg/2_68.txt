I got one of these to power my cell phone, I have an LG VX-9800, a Treo 700WX and a Samsung a950 and you think with all the tips supplied that I would be able to use it with one of the phones but no. I tried to give it to my daughter and it didn't fit her phone either. I never found anyone with a phone it fit to give it to.I just use it as a wind up flashlight now. If anyone finds a source of compatible tips for other model phones that work with this, I would like to know.
