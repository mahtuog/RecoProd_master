I have returned my chager to Motorolla under warranty two times. Each time Motorolla customer service was very nice about replacing it however the rear pocket for charging batteries has never worked. I've tested it with three batteries - 2 Li ION and 1 NiMH and it doesn't work with any in the rear pocket. It acts like its charging the battery but does not. The front pocket does a fine job of holding the phone and I haven't had trouble with the back holding the battery. If it worked it would be worth owning.
