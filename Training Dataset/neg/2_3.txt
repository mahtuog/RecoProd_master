Kudos to the dude/dude-ette who figured out that the Jabra ear gels might improve the bad, painful and ineffective stock rubber covers provided with your Jawbone product. The Jabra gels aren't a perfect solution for my Icon-Hero, but they're heaps better than the original earbud-nonsense supplied with the bluetooth unit (which I totally dig). Still, the drama of finding a way to "rig" a $100 electronic device from a reputable manufacturer so that it doesn't hurt your ear is not cool. Aliph-Jawbone are you listening? I know that all ears and fit requirements are different, but I'm just sayin'...really? Anyway, if you've been looking for an alternative to the problem(s) associated with the original, messed-up-a$$ earbuds, you might already know that you gotta use one of the round earbuds like the one on the unit when it was new so that the Jabra eargel can fit over it. Here's the thing: depending on which size Jabra eargel you use, you may have to swap out that stock Jawbone ear bud. I.E. - the large Jabra gel doesn't fit over the smallest, Jawbone ear bud. So be prepared to play with those combinations a bit as well as figuring out the right Jabra gel to get your best fit. Once you work that out, give it a chance as you and your ear may need a moment to adjust to how it feels. The volume improvement is nice too. Good luck.
