I bought this phone about a month ago and kind of liked it for a while. Then I noticed a lot of problems. The phone's camera is not good at all. I wanted to take a picture and had to use a lot of lights so the picture would look kind of good. When the picture is taken it looks pixelated. I mean you can see it in little squares. The pictures also take a lot of time to be taken. You press the capture button and then on the screen appears the message: &quot;PLEASE WAIT&quot; and if you move the phone during that time, the picture will come out as a blur. The reception of this phone is really bad too. The service can come and be full and then suddenly disappear. I tried to listen to a message but I didn't hear anything clearly. The keyboard is also kind of difficult to use. To enter the menu you have to press the joystick right in the middle or it will go to another page. The phone is really slow and can get frozen sometimes. When changing themes it takes about a minute.
