I bought this case last year. I had it only six weeks before the zipper began to rip. When they cut out the opening for the charger on the bottom, they cut into the fabric of the zipper. This jeapardizes the integrity of the zipper. As you slip this very tight cover on and zip it up, it pulls on that fabric tape. Because the tape has been cut, it has nothing to keep it from fraying and unraveling - in time it is inevitable. When I contacted Nokia about this product, they would do nothing for me - it was not covered for poor workmanship.
