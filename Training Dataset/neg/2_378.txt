Plantronics makes excellent Bluetooth products but the explorer 330 isn't one of them. I don't know if I just happened to get the 'bad apple' out of the bunch because I've had several problems with it. For starters, I can barely hear the person on the other end without static ringing in my ear. Also, when I'm on the phone I get consistent complaints that they can't hear me on the other end. Aside from that it's big & bulky, someone actually asked me 'why is your Bluetooth so big?' :/I have an iPhone 3G & Blackberry Curve, I got the same problems on both.
