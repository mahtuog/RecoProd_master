I dont normally review stuff. But i hate this product so much that i just couldn't resist. At least it wasnt expensive, is all i can say. I wish 0 stars was an option. Anyway, the tape keeps spitting out, occasionally it WILL work for a couple songs, while stopping briefly to (im guessing here) flip sides every few moments. Sound quality is a bit fuzzy when it actually plays and sometimes the volume is really low. What a waste.
