I'm one of those people who don't get caught up in bells and whistles, but am a stickler for good design and practical features.I've had the T610's predicessor, the T68i for over a year now, and by far my biggest problem with that phone is a reception that's poorer than other people's T-Mobile phones I'd compared it to. Other than this, I had minor gripes with the User Interface being slow, weak Bluetooth support and other silly design choices. Still, it was enough to make me buy it over the others.I decided to get the T610 to see if it addressed any of my issues with the T68i. The User Interface is much faster, and the display more pleasing (albeit hard to see in light, a minus). The phone-camera is an absolute joke - very poor quality - but most of these 1st generation phone-cameras are.HOWEVER, the big problem is (and this boggled my mind), the reception is _consistantly_and_significantly_worse_ than the t68i, when I would compare them side by side in different places around SF. Why they would design it this way when the T68i already suffers from poor reception is beyond me. Perhaps it was designed for Europe initially, where there is much stronger and consistant GSM coverage than in the US. At any rate, it was the deal breaker for me, and I returned the phone and cancelled the contract, which T-Mobile did quickly enough, after offering me a few carrots to keep the contract.Too bad. If the reception worked well, it would be the best phone out there. Selling a lot of these in the US can only hurt T-Mobile, as people will only blame the phone's lousy performance on them and move to another carrier. Sony Ericsson really needs to address this.
