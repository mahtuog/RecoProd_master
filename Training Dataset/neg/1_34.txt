I bought these Jabra Eargels from another retailer, because I thought they had the colored ones, which are supposedly more durable than their clear counterparts. Well, they did not have the colored ones, but the clear ones I received from them were horrible junk. I tried the pieces on before fitting them with headphones and the medium and large pieces fit great in my ear, I thought I was really going to like this product! I didn't consider to think that putting in the somewhat oversized earbud driver was going to stretch the entire piece. It took a lot of struggle to even get the earbud in in the first place, I had to let them warm up so that the material was at least somewhat stretchy first. I eventually got the earbuds to stay, and tried to fit them in my ear. Well, they wouldn't. They were stretched to far to fit in my ear AT ALL, it was like trying to force a square peg into a round hole.So I let them sit for a while and went to do something else, I come back and decide they're not for me(after trying all sizes), and when I'm packing them back up, I notice that the large size has a giant split right down the middle on both sides, leaving a tiny 3mm strip of material that hasn't torn through. I returned them, and who would blame me? See the title, this product is complete garbage.
