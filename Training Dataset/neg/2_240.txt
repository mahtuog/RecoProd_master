Unlike the fun but trendy faceplates this earth theme color has a distinctive look that also compliments any style. Because it is in neutral tones, you won't soon tire of it. The color has sheen to it that makes the color appear a different hue in different lighting. The dark undertones keep the phone looking new and clean unlike some of the lighter or laquer looking finishes that show every smudge and fingerprint. I often recieve compliments on the phone when among company. If you're looking for a fun change or different look but don't want to lock your phone into a novelty or bubble-gum look, the earth theme is a perfect choice!
