Within the past 5 months of having my cell phone, I have had to replace the hands-free earbud on the average of one every other week. The main reason: POOR ENGINEERING &amp;/or DESIGN. Every time you would sit down with the phone on your belt clip, the point of contact is always at the base of the phone right where your headset is attached, thus causing the fine wires coming out of the attachment to break. Also, the two plastic tabs that attach the headset to the cell phone are always breaking off ruining the use of the headset. These are the two major set backs on the &quot;Design.&quot; Just briefly a note on comfort of the earpiece. After a couple of uses, you will loose the padding on the earbud. After a hour or so with the earpiece placed properly into the ear it becomes very uncomfortable thus having to switch ears and causing the mic to be further from one's mouth making it very difficult for the other party to hear. My solution: Redesign the earpiece to the shape of one's inner ear. The attachment needs to be either a ninety degree angle (so wires come out to the side not bottom) or built to mount on the side of cell phone. After many e-mails to Nokia and calls they still will not accept the idea that it is ideed a poor design.
