Well, after reading good reviews about the Razr in various magazines and online I decided that I would get one since I was switching back to Verizon after having Cingular for 3 years, what a mistake!ProsThere really are no good things about this phone, some may like it because it is thin but I did't even like that aspect.ConsThe first problem I noticed with this phone is that it takes FOREVER to turn on. From the time you press the on button till you can make or receive a call is well over 1 minute. Therefore, if you are like me and don't use your cellphone every minute of your life and actually turn it off every once in a while you better hope you don't need to make an emergency call because you will likely be unconscious before this thing turns on. My 3 year old Nokia I had from Cingular turned on and could place a call within 5 seconds, beat that Razr.The second problem is that when you turn the phone off it makes a stupid sound that cannot be turned off or muted and is quite annoying.The thinness of the phone causes your hand to cramp up after about two minutes of use.The display on this phone sucks and is impossible to see in sunlight no matter which way you try to face it. The outer display doesn't even show when the phone is not in use and gets annoying when you try to use it as a clock and have to open it everytime.Battery life is horrible, it lasted about 1 hour and 15 minutes for me on a fully charged battery until it died, this is unacceptable in my book.Sound quality is very poor and whenever you talk into it you hear your own voice in the ear part of the phone which gets really annoying after about one minute.Reception is certainly not the best, the Motorola E815 that I got now gets full reception in places that this thing couldn't even find a signal.The interface is ugly and cannot be changed the red verizon bars on the top and bottom need to go and I like Motorolas interface much better.The OK button needs to be changed so that it is raised up or something because everytime you try to hit it you end up hitting one of the arrows instead.So there you have it that is why I didn't like this phone at all and returned it after two days for an E815 which by the way I am more than happy with. If you want a phone that makes and receives calls with good clarity and reception (which is what a phone is designed for) this is definitely not for you. I didn't test bluetooth, speaker, games, vcast, mp3 playing, etc. etc. because personally I could care less about those things and want a phone for a phone which this definitly is not.
