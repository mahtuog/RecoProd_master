The problem with Bluetooth headsets in general is they are near your ear but 4-5 inches your mouth. Therefore the microphone is reaching a long way to pick up your voice and has little ability to screen your voice from everything else around you. Unless you are in a quiet room, forget the current offerings of Bluetooth headsets.This headset is no exception.On the other hand, it is comfortable and works well if you need it where it excels, a quiet room.However, I'll wait until an offering is available that works outside the quiet confines of the design lab.
