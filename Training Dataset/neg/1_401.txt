I thought it was cool when I got it, but the more I used it, the more I hated it. I've missed countless calls because I couldn't hear it ringing. Navigating the user interface is unnecessarily complicated and slow. Switching ring modes requires you to navigate to the ring styles portion of the menu system, in my opinion, you should be able to change this without opening the phone. Battery life is horrible, if this phone goes into analog mode, you might as well turn it off, because the battery won't last more than a few minutes. I'm considering re-activating my old Kyocera QCP-860 ThinPhone.
