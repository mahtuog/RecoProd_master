I received this battery in good time with prompt shipping. Unfortunately, it was worse than the battery I was replacing. I got approximately 4 to 6 hours of life on standby primarily! I asked if this was refurbished or with an old manufacture date and was told it was new with a 2009 manufacture date.The company was responsive and professional and promptly sent me another battery. The replacement was just as bad as the first. I received a refund without a problem. I ordered this battery through another company as well and received another piece of junk too!Unfortunately, I have to use another phone since I can't find a good battery. Anybody have any ideas (other than a $50 battery)?
