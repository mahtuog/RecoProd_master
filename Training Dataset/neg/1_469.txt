this is the most disappointing item I have purchase from .... I must say it is flimsy to say the least. The phone has a tendency to drop out of it so be very CAREFUL!! I recommend spending $5-$10 more and get the leather case (which I have) it also allows you to rotate the phone for when you sit. This might seem odd, but the phone will not cut into your stomach while driving.
