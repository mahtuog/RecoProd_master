I liked mine at first but it didn't hold up. I've had mine about a month and it's falling apart. It's too bad because I really liked it.As far as the comments from others regarding the phone freezing on when it's open it's the 2 bottons (contacts and message). I found that if you trim the plastic around those bottons that fixes that issue.
