Fits ok. Stretches on easily (does not snap). No cut outs for any of the buttons on the middle of the phone (Palm Treo 755p) Can't see the power, green, five way, or the menu buttons. You either have to remember where they are, or use a fine blade to cut out the holes. Matte black. Will offer some protection against scratches. It does fit the qwerty keyboard nicely, no obstruction of any of these keys. Also no obstruction of the camera lens. Can't open the card slot-cut out too small. OK for now, but will keep looking for one that fits correctly.
