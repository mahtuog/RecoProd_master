When I bought my blackberry, my battery lasted for 2 days of intensive use. It went like that for a full year and then in a matter of a week or two my battery life halved, I could only get a day out of it of not so quite an intensive use. I was delighted to see that Amazon offered a new battery at what seemed a very attractive price, in comparison with what a cell store would charge. However, after using this battery that I purchased from amazon I get the same sort of medium sized day that I get with my old battery. This leads me to conclude that the vendor is recycling used batteries as new ones. It is cheap, but it is not new. If you don't have a battery at all get it. If you want to replace your old battery pay the $40 at a cell store and get the really new one.
