i think that logitech make the best accessories. I have the camera, the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard..... so naturally this headset was a no brainer. The reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public.It worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the Logitech Bluetooh hub. Don't you find that strange? Aside from that, it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone (can't remember the model). In addition, it really hurts my ears.. not the most comfortable.... so you decide if this product works for you.
