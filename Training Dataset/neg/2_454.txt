I have 3 phones:nokia 6610, motorola v60g and sony ericsson T-610.Even with a broken antenna the V60g gives me better reception than the T 610. I have T-mobile on all three phones, so the T 610's poor reception couldn't be because of network problems.The camera quality is pretty poor and I sorely miss the loudspeaker option that is present in the 6610.I feel that the next phone that I'll buy is going to be a motorola; their phones are very intuitive to use as compared to nokia/sony ericcson.Also, before opting for T-mobile - please please please - check the network connectivity in your locality. I have been hanging out of my apartment window for too long now to try to get a signal.
