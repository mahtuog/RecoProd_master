Won't stay behind the ear, ear piece won't stay in ear cannal, cuts out and sometimes won't respond at all. To get a good reception with the cell phone on my hip directly under the earpiece, I have to take the phone out of the case and hold directly under or in front of the earpiece, no more than one foot. I thought these things were supposed to make my life easier.
