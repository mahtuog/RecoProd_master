I bought this locally because I've always been a Monster fan. Put it in the car, tuned it (the full band tuning was nice) and the buttons felt totally cheap. They were loose feeling. With the cheap FM Transmitter I had I got clear stereo sound, picked up no engine or transmission whine or static unless in a large city. With the Monster, I heard transmassion whine no matter where in the car I placed it. The sound was muffled as if I had the treble all the way down although the bass was very good. It did not work with the headphone jack on my Cingular 8125 Pocket PC for MP3s. With that device it only played out of one side of the stereo speakers. THEN, for some reason, the internal fuse would keep tripping even when I had the volume on the CD player all the way down. The display would flash "8888" and I had to unplug it and plug it back in to reset it.The good thing is it looked slick and was unobtrusive. I took it back to Radio Shack the next day.If you want a GOOD FM Transmitter, check out the Accurian FM Transmitter. It's the same price, will seek out the clearest frequency for you and is as unobtrusive as the Monster. I'm wondering if Monster made it for Radio Shack and put MUCH MUCH better quality/components in it. It's the same price and works GREAT!!My opinion? Stick with Monster for audio/video cables, but go with someone else for wireless transmitters.
