I bought this phone last year on Amazon. I liked the sleek design, the color and I was very attracted to the touchscreen. The phone works quite well, talk time is good and standby time is great. I had no problems with syncing it to my computer. The bluetooth works well too. The phone can take some good banging as this has dropped from me several times with the battery flying out, and it still works fine. The one and only con I would give it (which is a major one) is that there is no other option for navigating around the menu in the phone except for the touchscreen. Some other phones have a touchscreen, but still have buttons that you can press to get in the menu and work the phone. This one only has the touchscreen, so if that screen goes bad...you can forget even having a phone because you won't be able to make a call, send a text, play a game, change your phone settings....nothing that you can usually do while navigating around in the menu. This is the problem that I am having right now. I sadly dropped the phone in a puddle of water a while back. The phone still works fine, functional-wise, but the touchscreen has freezed and no longer works, so I can't do anything with the phone. This is the major problem as I think that they should have also put in some buttons so that you can still get in your menu. Now, I have to look for another phone to buy. I like LG products so I will stick with this brand, I will just make sure to buy a phone with menu, select and navigation buttons.
