I had this headset for about three weeks before returning it due to frustration. It was electrically defective, so I won't touch on that, but the ergonomics left much to be desired.It's billed as being good for people with glasses due to the little rubber thing that ingeniously tucks inside the curves of your ear. Unfortunately, it was uncomfortable for me, no matter how I trimmed the plastic. It may be comfortable for others, but it is worth noting that I couldn't get it to feel right even after patiently adjusting it for a couple weeks.Another problem is that it is tough to know whether the piece is set correctly in the ear. If it is, the audio is nice and loud. If it isn't, the sound is barely audible. A device that goes in the ear canal is a double-edged sword in this way. I'd put it on and fiddle with the volume buttons and adjusted them using the beeps produced, but when I answered a call, the headset may have shifted slightly, and the headset required more adjustment.The power button is on the front of the unit and sticks out. On top of that, the button requires very little pressure to activate. This makes it very easy to accidentally turn on if you put it in your pocket. This would be fixed if they designed the button "countersunk" into the unit.I think the idea for securing a headset in this way is good, and I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't.
