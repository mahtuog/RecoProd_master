ATTENTION COMPUTER HEADSET USERS: Do not spend the extra money for the Universal Adapter. The adapter only works with the headphones not the microphone. If you must have this headset get the Plantronics Pulsar 590E and then some other bluetooth card instead. Or better yet, just get a headset with a wire and save yourself the money and the hassle. Bluetooth is overrated.
