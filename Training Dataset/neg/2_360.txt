It works! I had a Motorola headset and I liked the performance, but it always felt like it was going to fall off my ear. I tried the Plantronics because it looked like it would fit more secure. The Plantronics fits very nice, I played soccer and forgot it was there. However, performanc wise, it tends to be staticky and tends to mute you as a noise reduction feature :). Next time, I'm spending more money to get performance and fit.
