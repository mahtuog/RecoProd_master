Pros: Fits firmly in either ear. Looks good. Holds charge for a long time.Cons: Amplifies surrounding noise (even air flow from vents)! Slow to connect when answering a call. Connection with handset fades in and out on any call at anytime in any location.I would never recommend this product to anyone. 2-stars.
