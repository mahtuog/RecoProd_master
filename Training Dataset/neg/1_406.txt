I got suckered in with the original price and then how much you get back when you sign up for service.1. Do not use T-Mobile. Nothing but problems and thier service range is horrible.2. I agree with the camera. It stinks.3. Not taking the charge is annoying. Sometimes I have to play with the phone for sometimes 20 minutes so I can charge it overnight.4. The phone is not durable at all and the screen turns all blue after opening the phone after it has been off the charger for an hour or so. The phone will not function right and I have to close it and wait for a few minutes for the phone to reset. My sister in laws does the same thing. The phone should not do this.Overall, I should have chose a little more wisely and know why they are giving so much back when you purchase the phone.
