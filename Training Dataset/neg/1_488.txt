I ordered this phone and a V400 from Cingular ... the order was cancelled ... I was told by amazon.com that they can't tell why ... they gave me a Cingular number ... I called Cingular and was given the run-around ... eventually, they told me they can't tell me why it was denied and that I have to ask amazon.com ... this is amazing ... I have very, very good credit so I know it's not a credit issue ... I'm frustrated because I ordered it on the day the phone had a significant rebate and now the rebate is no longer valid.
