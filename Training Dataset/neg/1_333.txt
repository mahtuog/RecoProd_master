I had a NON extended Samsung battery for nearly three years and needed to replace it. Well I purchased the EXTENDED version of this battery fully believing it would work great. Well I was VERY surprised to find out that it actually gave me LESS talk time then my 3 year old NON EXTENDED battery. It could not even hold a charge for one day.When I contacted the company for a refund they REFUSED to accept the return because I did not keep the original packaging which is crazy because it is a battery and who would expect a battery not to work?But WAIT, it gets WORSE!!When I posted a negative feedback, they contacted me and asked me to remove it and they would give me a refund. I removed it and they NEVER gave me the refund.So NOT only does this company produce DEFECTIVE products they lie and don't honor their word.They deserved to be removed from Amazon. I have contacted their security department and they are conducting a full investigation. In the meantime. DO NOT purchase ANYTHING from this vendor.They are EVIL and will likely soon be banned from Amazon.
