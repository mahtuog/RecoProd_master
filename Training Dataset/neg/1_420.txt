i ordered a car charger for a particular Nokia phone, because i left the charger overseas. Was suprised at the VERY low price, but the shipping and handling is where these people make their money. So when the info on their site was bad, the charger did not work and guess who carries the bag? A charger for 2 bucks and a 8 buck shipping, now if i pay $5 more i can send it back and maybe end up with the right charger, MAYBE. All this taking weeks to accomplish. Does your time have any value???? Don't order from them if it does.
