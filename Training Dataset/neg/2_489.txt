The case I received is not the one pictured here, although it is the same product name and number. The case I received is a single piece, clear plastic cover. It does not have a flip over piece, as is shown here. It's very difficult to use as the buttons are inacessible through the plastic, meaning you have to take it out each time to use it.The vendor should show the actual item, not a completely different one.
