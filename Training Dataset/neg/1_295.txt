I sent a letter on Aug 15,2005 to Batteries Guy at 264 Hewes St, Brooklyn New York (the return address on the shipping envelope) asking them to please ship the correct item and some information on returning the battery that did not fit my phone. I have not yet received a reply. There was no phone number or e-mail address in the package.
