The product description on Amazon's web page indicates that this headset is compatible with the Nokia 2600 phone. So I ordered two of them together, but neither one worked with my Nokia 2600. Since the seller would only refund my purchase price and original shipping charges, I had to pay the return shipping costs myself. So I'm now back to square one with no headset for my phone -- and with less money in the bank than before. The only reason I'm giving this headset one star is because I wasn't able to proceed with my review unless I rated it at least one star!
