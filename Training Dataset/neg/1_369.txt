The product is absolute crap. The USB cable is faulty and does not properly fit into the keyboard or the computer jack. Once I managed to get both ends to insert (with great care and effort) did the keyboard charge? Nope. Also the pairing button didn't work.Avoid avoid avoid. Do not buy this product.
