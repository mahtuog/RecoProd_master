There is really nothing very good about this product.First of all, the construction is pretty cheap, which is to be expected for under $20, I guess. It's all plastic and not very well engineered.Second, and by far more important, the sound quality is TERRIBLE! I've tried every open FM station on my dial, and while I get better sound quality in the lower range (88.1 or so), I would still describe the sound quality as "something you might expect on an old transistor radio during a thunderstorm". The bass notes are distorted and buzzy, the treble notes aren't clear, and the vocals sound very screechy most of the time. I've got an XM receiver that I play through the FM radio on the same car stereo, and the sound quality from that is so much better it's not even comparable to what I get from this product, so it's not a problem with the concept in general, or even with my radio. It's this product.Honestly, I regret buying this, even for the $15 that I spent, since the sound quality is so bad I can't enjoy the music it plays at all. I'm going to keep my eyes open for another option, but for now I guess I'll just stick to burning my music to CDs like the old days... Oh, for a digital port in my car stereo...
