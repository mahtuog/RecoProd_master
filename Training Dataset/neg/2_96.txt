I purchased the 250 device for my new Treo 650. I am very disappointed and will be packing it up to send back (the Jabra...not the Treo). I've tried it for a week and can't take it anymore. The only PRO I can think of is that it is light and comfortable. I do have a lot of CONS:1. Range is supposed to be 15 feet. Yeah right...try less than 5 feet.2. If you have the phone on one side of your body (i.e. in a belt clip) with the headset on the other side, it simply does not work. I don't mean it sort of doesn't work, I mean it doesn't work at all--every time.3. When I have everything in order for it to work properly (i.e. the headset is within 2 feet of my phone on the same side of my body), the reception is spotty at best. Time and again, the person on the other end of the phone asks me if I am in a wind tunnel. At other times, they tell me that I'm fading in and out.4. About 30% of the time, the Jabra does not realize my Treo has rung. So, I end up having to not use it.5. When the Jabra does realize my Treo as rung, it takes about 5 seconds for it to realize this. As such, the Treo continues to ring. This causes me to fret...should I wait for the Jabra to realize my treo is ringing and risk losing the call to my voicemail? Or should I answer the phone. If I answer the phone prematurely (i.e. before the Jabra realizes it has rung), it takes about 3 seconds for the Jabra to connect. During this time, the person on the other end is talking and I can't hear.All in all, I considered giving this product a one-star rating.If you buy this...keep your receipt handy.
