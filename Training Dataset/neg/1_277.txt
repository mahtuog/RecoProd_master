WARNING! Before you buy this phone for Verizon, I have to warn you - the picture transfer and mp3/ringtone transfer are disabled. From what I understand, Verizon is the ONLY company that does this, which forces you to use their own service and pay their fees.Their own ad copy in this very item (above) says "It also supports polyphonic ringtones as well as MP3 ringers, allowing you to use portions of your favorite songs to alert you to incoming calls."Yeah. They don't tell you that you can't transfer without using their high-fee data service. With everyone else, you can just connect the phone to a cable.If you want a RAZR phone - do NOT get one from Verizon!
