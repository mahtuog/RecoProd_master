I received this case less than a week ago. Because my phone is new, I've been using it a lot, setting up all of the different features. Today, the case seemed to be getting sticky, and I discovered that the coating was disintegrating/melting and was scraping off, leaving it in a matt, tacky state. The paint has also already begun to chip off and I haven't treated it badly at all.I also have the Jet Black FlexSkin Case which I also wouldn't recommend - the sliding element was coming unglued from the case when it arrived and unless you know the phone button arrangement really well, you can't be sure you're pressing the right buttons as you can't see through the black skin. Perhaps the Frosted Clear version would be better for that at least.I love the phone but I can't seem to find a case that will protect it and keep it easily useable. I've yet to try the Fosmon Crystal Clear hard case - perhaps that'll be next!
