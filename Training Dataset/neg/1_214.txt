I got this for 4.99 from a private seller Not Amazon. THIS THINGS ANCIENT and weighs 5 pounds. I thought of buying more and connecting them all to a bar to make a homeade weight lol. I will always go Amazon.com from now on. I click on the seller Amazon.con b4 I ever buy anything now after this. Oh and Amazon refunded me...not the seller. Freakn thing turns your phone or tablet off when u plug it in...Bad buy.
