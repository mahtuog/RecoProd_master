I got this phone a year back,i had a Nokia earlier.I never had a problem with my Nokia.But with this one even after a year i never hear it.Mainly in crowded places etc,its never heard.The menu is difficult to Navigate and also everything needs lot of steps.Im just waiting for the year to get over so i can rid of it.I dont recomend it to anyone
