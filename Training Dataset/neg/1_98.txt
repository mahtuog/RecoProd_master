I would not even give this phone to my 4 year old. My daughter was recently hospitalized out of town, and for convenience sake I had to use my cell phone instead of long distance. I moved around, went outside (under a clear sky) and had absolutly horrible reception. The entire time you are on the phone with someone, you expect them to disappear, because his phone is terrible. Pick something else.
