Used this one for about a month and a half before it fell apart. The glue on the earpiece failed and now the speaker plug is hanging loose from its cheap plastic casing. The ear fit wasn't too comfortable either. I bought this because I didn't want one of those dangling mics, and this one looked less geeky than some of the other choices (like the Plantronics), but am now very much regretting my decision. btw, a coworker bought the Plantronics, and it has much better sound and build quality.
