I wrote a review before, It WAS great. how things change the ear piece fell apart and now the headset is useless. I adjusted the rating downward. Beware.*****ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS******This model is far superior to the Ericsson hand-free model. I used the Ericsson hands-free and I was always straining to hear. With the Body Glove model I have no problem hearing or others hearing me.Also the Ericsson model has nothing to hold the earpiece you must shove it down your ear canal. Not good hygiene.Must have especially now as it is illegal to drive with a cellular phone in hand in NY
