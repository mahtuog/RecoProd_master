Overall Pros:* Fantastic sound when used as HEADPHONES with the supplied analog adapter.Overall Cons:* MONO sound when used as HEADSET with mic (both ears, just mono output)* LAGS behind video/game just under a second.* Tech Support nightmares. Dealt with liars and wiseasses.First, installed it on my primary box (XP SP2) with both a generic BTv1.1 adapter and then the IOGear GBU321. Used both dongle provided drivers and BlueSoliel drivers. In all situations, the sound quality was less than ideal as it sounded like it was being played through a speakerphone and found the headset (when mic is used) only outputting in MONO (no more listening to Pink Floyd during games). This annoyed me immediately as Tech Support TOLD me it was stereo output.This device is only good as a Skype headset or walk-around-the-house headphones (using the adapter).Secondly, this is what happened when I tried to contact Tech Support installing it on Vista (which did not work).Matt S:Hi, you have reached Matt S in Technical Support. How may I help you?You: I have a Plantronics 590a, and was wondering how I can pair it with VistaYou: my bluetooth dongle has been found and when I attempt to start the pairing process it asks me for drivers 4 times.You: upon inspection, this seems to be each of the services that the headset provides (Audio Sync, Remote control, Headset, and Telephony)Matt S: I can't support vista, so I'm not sure. as long as the pc supports the A2DP blue tooth Stereo profile, it should work. I don't know about different software applications however.You: anyone who can support vista?Matt S: Microsoft I would imagine.You: quite the sense of humor you have. I'm more curious as to the nature of your company and its vista driver support for its productsMatt S: We simply support the headset here, and not all the different applications and software programs out there.Matt S: we have an FAQ regarding vista on our Support page.Matt S: Thank you for choosing Plantronics.Let us know if you need further assistance.***** Matt S Has Disconnected
