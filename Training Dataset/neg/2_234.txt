I am very tech savvy when it comes to cell phones, and I must say the 550i looked very promising on paper: Quad Band, bluetooth, 2.0 MP camera with xenon flash, etc. But when I got the phone and placed the sim card, I noticed the antenna reception is far inferior to some other phones I have used, such as Nokia N73, or even Sony Ericsson K750i. I would routinely get "no reception" and would take the phone quite some time to pick up reception again. Other than the antenna issue (which is a big deal) the other features and functionality of the phone are superb. Nice tactile feel to the buttons, the menus and submenus can be accessed in a flash with minimal lag time. The software on the camera is not quite as user friendly as the K750i and i feel the picture quality is not as good either (even though k750i also has a 2 MP camera). Had I known what I know now, I would decline to purchase this phone again
