Two Loops are provided with the head set. The loops are made of hard plastic. Both broke in the same place within 2 weeks. Nothing is provided to put the head set in. Voice recognition is very sensitive any change in tone the name is not recognised. Hearing conversations is good. Volume buttons are little small to use.
