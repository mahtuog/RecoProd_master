I had this phone for three days before rushing to return it. I LOVE the look and feel of the phone as well as the keypad. All wonderful. Don't get me started on the 2mp camera with "flash." GREAT! I also love that you cannot overcharge the battery as well as the feature where if you can't get to the phone right away, a message will tell the caller to hold on a sec. One of the reasons I returned it is the alarm. You have to set it EVERY NIGHT! I have friends with Motorola phones and their phones had the multi-alarm feature where you can set it by day, etc. Why doesn't THIS phone have that? Another thing that got on my nerves was the UI. Samsung has spoilt me with their numbered menus. Pressin' the down key nine times to get to the 9th menu option when I can just press the no. 9 key just doesn't make sense to me in this day and age. The speaker phone isn't loud enough either. Hey, if I didn't take enough time to get to know the phone and I'm wrong about any of this, please lemme know. I opted for a Samsung Blast. Looooove it! Got my numbered menus and the "flash" on the Motorola Rizr z3 is nothing compared to all the frames, clip art and other fun stuff you can do with Samsung's camera options. Still I can't stop thinkin' about the Rizr z3. However, when I get past its looks, the romance is done.
