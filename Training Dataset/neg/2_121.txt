As previously mentioned there is a lag of approx. .5 sec. I purchased these for use when practicing playing a guitar. Hitting a string and then hearing the sound .5 seconds later made my otherwise poor playing that much worse and made them unusable.I tried to test them as a headset with my HP bluetooth enabled notebook as well but was unable to get them to recognize each other and I finally gave up. I did not have this problem with another bluetooth headset I have.Tech. support at Plantronics was less than helpful. They insisted the lag was normal and typical of all wireless headphones.If all you need them for is to listen to music they may suffice. But consider the audio lag if you want them for any other purpose.
