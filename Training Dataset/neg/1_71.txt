Okay so I guess I didn't read the 1 or 2 reviews that said the case doesn't close shut.It clicks shut then flips open. Anyway I will return what is essentially a pointless product now. Very disappointed.Seems the build quality is inconsistent as most reviews said it shut fine but 1 or 2 did report this problem
