I bought this phone (T610) 6 months ago. At first I loved it, but after a few weeks I started to notice how slow it was. Although it looks cool on the outside, there are too many problems with it concerning the price. The menus are complicated and certain processes take much longer than they should. This phone has freezed many times and is veryyy frustrating to use at times. After removing the back cover to change the camera reflector to the mirror, the battery moved, and I put it back in its correct spot. However when I turned on the phone, it says "No access." Do not buy this phone unless you like being frustrated and annoyed the majority of the time using it!
