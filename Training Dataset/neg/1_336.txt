I bought the unlocked TREO 600 one year ago for $549. It has been replaced 3 times. I gave up and bought the unlocked 650. It crashed in 2 weeks. I returned it. I am now stuck with a 600 that is now out of warranty. Service: forget about it. All you will get is put on hold from India and they charge $25 per call after a few months. The 600 reboots itself, turns itself off, loses all email settings, causes duplicates in OUTLOOK. 13 birthday reminders is 12 too many. It corrupted my address book and changed people's names and phone numbers, even after I did a hard reset and uninstalled and reinstalled the software. You will never get to talk to a US Palm tech, only India. I bought this from the Palm store. The phone has known issues with older SIM cards. I am now getting the Blackberry.
