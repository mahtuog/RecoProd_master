I didn't have this phone for 2 weeks when it failed on me twice within 72 hrs! I'm so disappointed as it's a sharp-looking phone with nice features and good sound clarity. But the display froze and could only be restored to service by removingthe battery. I returned it to Cingular as I can't deal with such unreliable performance.
