This is an overpriced, under-engineered and generally inferior product. The sound quality on it is good, and it certainly is more discreet than other competing products (people have thought I was talking to myself while wearing it), but there are better options out there.You will love this for the few months prior to it breaking. I have had mine for around 4 months and the prongs are destroyed. The ones for other phones do not do this because of their design. If you put a pad on the earpiece it is much more comfortable and won't slip from your ear as much. It does increase safety in the car. For thirty dollars Nokia could design something better.The Jabra one I own seems a little more sturdy, and costs less to replace (if it breaks). My reccomendation, is that if you aren't concerned with looks too much, go for the Jabra. So far I have not had any trouble with it, besides the fact that it is huge. If you won't be using the Nokia headset much, try your luck with it, but don't say I didn't warn you...
