It's your basic phone.It calls, it receives, and keeps a phonebook.It has one game, and the basics of calculator, memo, calendar.The graphics/wallpaper isn't that great, but it's just a cheap phone anyway.It has some cheesy ringtones, rather ridiculous actually seeing as how my friends are always laughing whenever they hear my ringtone.It has a vibrate feature, but you can only use the vibrate feature for two levels: when silent & on vibrate, or when on loudest & on vibrate. Anything in between like on level three ringer, vibrate is unavailable.The mirror on the cover is fairly useless, except for the occasions when you need a quick check for food in your teeth.Yeah, the buttons on the side push easily from vibrate feature to the maximum level, but it doesn't happen too often.Occasionally the screen stays black for 5-10 seconds when the phone is flipped open quickly, which is pretty dumb, seeing as the point of a flip phone is to "flip" open the phone quickly to view the screen. Go figure.The weight of the phone is surprising. Very light. I like the compactness and lightness of it. A big plus.The phone responds about 3-5 seconds from when you push a button. It's a little aggravating.The earpiece is rather irritating too. You always have to smash the earpiece against your ear to hear someone screaming from the other end. In turn, you must scream into the mouthpiece to have the other party hear you. And if you're wondering, it's not the service quality. I tested it with my old Nokia 3595, where I can hear perfectly fine and whisper and have the other party hear me.The battery life has been okay for the past 1 and 1/2 years I've had this phone. Sometimes the battery lasts a long time, but other times, the battery drains for no apparent reason.Regarding signal, I receive about 1/2 the signal on the LG than what I receive on my old Nokia 3595.
