I am not sure if I missed something but I may have been given a used battery. Initially the battery life had a good 2 days of normal usage but yesterday I took my phone off the charger around 5 pm and this morning when I woke up at 6 am it was almost dead. I made one short call and had a few text messages so I am not sure why now after a week and a half of using it that it wont last a full day.
