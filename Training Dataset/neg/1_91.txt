NOT even an 'entry level' phone as they would have useful basic functions. Entry level should have a screen you can see in the light and a reliable ringer. Display has no brightness adjust only contrast which is useful for making the screen harder to see not improve. Using any wallpaper but white makes the screen impossible to see/read text even indoors in all but a dark room. Fonts have a setting to enlarge (Nokia knew the screen was junk) text but the small display prevents this. Calls have barely audible sound quality to understand the conversation (not due to signal). Buttons are too small for hands larger than medium-sized fingers and don't always make contact first time. Screen back-light doesn't always light when first button is pressed. When backlight is off screensaver time display is impossible to read when activated. Battery time is good most likely due to screen being dimly lit. User settings are all over the place in a unintuitive fashion making personal settings a time consuming chore instead of one menu.I can do w/o camera, web, mp3, radio etc. but to fail in the basic functions of a cell phone is pretty bad & not acceptable. No wonder they PAY you $150.00 to take the phone.NO STARS
