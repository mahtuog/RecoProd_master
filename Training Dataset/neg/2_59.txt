i have this phone, but in the prepaid version. It is the cingular GO PHONE. I have some likes and even more dislikes of this phone. In prepaid version, it only has one game, spaceball. Which is just SNAKE with a different name. It says you can go on the different types of instant messangers, use the internet, and download different graphics, tones & games. but that is not true. every time i go to use any of them .. it always say GPRS not found. i have no clue waht that means, but i guess prepaid versions were ripped off with the choice of internet and pretty much all fun, if any, with this fone. This fone has good quality ringers, only 1 or 2 good backrounds. HORRIBLE reception. every time i try calling my friends out on my bike or something, i have to jam the fone up to my ear just to hear them. it has vibrate which is good for when im in class, because my parents always tell me to turn off my fone is school, but when you turn it off, if anyone calls, you wont be able to see missed calls if its turned off so i just keep it on.it has .. i think 20 ringtones. theyre ok. it has speed dial. but no voice dial and no voice recorder :( also no speaker :(it does have 255 fone book entries available and i think it has like 3 way calling and call waiting so thts ok. so yeh i guess i wood reccommend this fone .. but now let me recap all the things this fone dont have SPEAKERFONE, VOICE DIALING, VOICE RECORDER, INTERNET, RINGTONE,GRAPHIC,GAME AND MULTIMEDIA DOWNLOAD, CAMERA, VIDEO CAMERA, ughh i dont know why i even got this fone but yeah thats all the things it doesnt have so there ya go. and if you want good reception, dont get this fone !!
