At first I was in love with this phone. The text messaging system is awesome, the screen is nice and big with a good picture quality, and the size is an advantage. It also can be very loud if need be, although that wears the battery down rather quickly. It also has the advantage of having a USB port for a charger, which makes the likelihood of having a friend with the same charger higher. HOWEVER, it's small sliding size makes it a little bit fragile. After having this seemingly perfect phone for two and a half months, it is doing some weird things. First, it loses service extremely easily, which it did not do at first. That wouldn't be so bad if the screen didn't also go white whenever this happened. Whenever it whites out like that, I can't do anything; I can't look at pictures, or my numbers, and if I'm working on a textmessage, it gets lost and not saved to drafts. It happens all the time. Obviously this is extremely annoying, and it would seem that the phone is either badly designed, or broken. I have not been unusually rough on this phone, so I don't believe that it should be broken so early on in it's lifespan. My best guess is that the rizer is a problem prone phone, and I would think twice about buying one if I were you.
