Well I took a chance on these. I read previous reviews and believed what they said...Always go with your first instincts. I should have known better. They looked too big in the pictures, but the reviews made it sound like only a tiny part of these ear gels actually went in your ear. So I took a chance on them.I was so disappointed. They come with three sizes, however even the smallest size is much bigger than the ear bud on the Jabra bluetooth device, which was the initial problem. Don't believe previous reviews that tell you that these will solve the problem, they make it worse.I now have the newest, most expensive Jabra bluetooth device that will not stay in my ear. When it is in correctly it is very painful. I am now going to purchase the earbuds that I thought sounded good before I read the reviews. I will update then.
