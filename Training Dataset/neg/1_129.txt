I ordered this product to replace a phone my daughter broke.. when it arrived it was blue.. which I needed a phone so I didn't care.. and then I turned it on and found that is a Motorola China.. which could not be activated where I live.. and was programed to work in chinese. so I had to send it back.. I paid 12 dollars to send it back and J&R ( the comapany in NY where the phone was shipped from) would not give me a full refund.. and then it is only a store credit.. in which, I would never buy anything from there again to start with. very very dissatisfied
