Received this belt clip today after a 6 week wait (ordered on August 4th). It finally shows up today, and it's not the right one for use with a Siemens S56!!!The box says it's compatible with the L56 series and also the M46 and S46.The Siemens part number for this item IS L36880-N5601-A125, just as Amazon indicates. However, it's NOT compatible with the S56!!Basically, if you look at your S56, you'll see the two little holes on the sides where the clip is supposed to attach. The "arms" of this belt clip are way too long. They were meant to reach around the sides of the phone to little holes on the front half of a phone, not the back half where the mounting holes are on the S56.If you've ordered this for the S56 and waited as long as I have, you're in for a disappointment. Shipping this one back to Amazon tomorrow...
