This is by far the worst fitting phone case I've ever seen. It doesn't even lookgood. The case makes it hard to use the buttons on the side and the bottom front of the case hangs out from the face making it dificult to turn the phone on and off. Unfortunately, I can't find another brand for this phone. Don't waste your money on this. A scratched phone looks better than one with this case.
