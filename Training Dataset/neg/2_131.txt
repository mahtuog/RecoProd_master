-they hadn't designed it to attach to your phone with a coiled wire. why not just a shorter straight wire? i wanted a retractable thing so that i wouldn't have to fight with the wire anymore. i'm still fighting it.-it weren't as big as my phone-the earbud weren't so delicate. the only reason i'm still using it is because, after the first one i bought utterly failed after about 10 minutes of use... and i argued with customer service for an hour or two, sent it back to nokia, and demanded my money back... they then sent me a new one. this one still works after a year... but i'm careful with it when i argue with the wire.
