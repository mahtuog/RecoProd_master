Got this phone for about 6 months, and overall it is ok, not as user friendly as Nokia, but get used to it. One bad thing is this phone will freeze itself. Try to exchange with another phone, but T-Mobile exchange program only give a refurbished one, not a new one, and after exchange, only have limited warranty.
