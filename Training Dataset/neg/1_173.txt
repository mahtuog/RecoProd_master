A few words to the wise, Don't buy this phone!!! I got this phone as an upgrade w/ my contract renewal, and was it a mistake! This phone is straight crap! Let's just say, don't EVER, EVER EVER EVER DROP THIS PHONE!I dropped this phone One time and it straight stopped working! I couldn't believe it, so guess what, I dropped it again and figured, I dropped it and it stopped working, lets see if this works.. And Wholla! It started working again. I had an older Nokia, similar to this model. and that phone would take a lickin' and keep on tickin. This thing, is just plastic w/ some lights. How many ways can I say it... GARBAGE!
