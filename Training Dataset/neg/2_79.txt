I purchased this item from WIRELESS UNLIMITED in Texas. Although it is being sold as a new OEM Blackberry battery, allegedly the same as what comes with one's Blackberry, I don't think it is. Why? First of all, my Blackberry is only 4 months old, and its original battery is marked "Made in Japan." While this battery at first glance has the same label (quite easy to fake, of course), it is actually marked "Made in China." Another subtle difference is that the OEM battery that came with my Blackberry listed its milliamps (if I recall, 1400 mA). This battery has no designation at all of its amp rating. Now considering that the real thing costs $40-$50 at most cellular retail stores, and this item was one-seventh the price, what can I expect? Still, there is the little matter of false advertising...they are calling this genuine OEM. The "made in China" label, the lack of a retail package (it arrived in a little plastic pouch, unmarked), and most importantly, the inferior performance, all suggest FRAUD. Also -- they charged me [...] shipping and handling even though it was sent 1st class in a tiny envelope at a cost of about [...] at most. I would not trust this seller again.
