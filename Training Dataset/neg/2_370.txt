Good news = The Bluetooth works, had not problem synching to my blackberry.Bad news = Horrible clarity, if there is any sort of road noise the person on the other end cannot hear you! (whats the point of hands free?!?!) You never know when the Bluetooth is low on battery, and you cant turn it off..if you turn it on it runs for a long time. Sometimes when you already have it on your year and you want to end a call it will not end the call. When you want to make a call it goes to "voice command" instead of just regular dial which can be annoying because your phone cant hear you on the Bluetooth. The sound gets very garbled if you are more than a foot away from your phone (again whats the point) I have heard bad things about all Bluetooth headsets so this is just like all the others, but its a good price so if you really NEED one get it anyway (rather pay less then more for a crapy product in general)
