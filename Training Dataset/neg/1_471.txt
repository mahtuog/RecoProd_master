I'm really dissapointed with the leather design. It looks like it fits the phone like a sock but it doesn't. First of all, the hole for the microphone does not line up. Second, the phone is so bulky until it opens itself with just a slight bump. The phone does not shut itself easily when you close it after talking. Third, the phone does not open fully with the leather case on....it feels weird talking through the case. The material used for the speakers feels really cheap. I don't know what to do with it now....sell it to someone cheap? Or I may have to just give them to some family member as a gift and let them figure this out. In conclusion, I wasted my $$ on this!!
