The biggest downside to this keyboard isn't really the fault of the manufacturer; Apple will not allow external keyboards to use auto-capitalize and auto-correction features. Beyond that, however, there is only one shift key on the left side of the keyboard, making it impossible to capitalize half of the letters easily. Also, the keyboard jiggles a bit when it slides back under the phone. I have tried to begin the process of returning mine, but customer service has not responded to my request nearly one week after I made it. Bottom line: if you want a physical keyboard, you probably shouldn't have an iPhone in the first place.
