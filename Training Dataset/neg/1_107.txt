I am actually on my second phone because the other just stopped working. Sometimes it would not allow me to touch certain keys, so I sent it back to Cingular. I thought the problem would be resolved after I got a new phone, but I was wrong. Now sometimes when I go to use the phone I will try to dial out and it will say EMERGANCY ONLY and all bars are full for reception. Another thing it does is go off on it's own. It also takes a long time to read the sim card when turned on about a minute. Another issue is the ring tones are verylow on sound so I hardly ever hear it ring unless on vibrate and it's in my pocket. Sometimes to phone will alert me of a voice mail message but no list of missed call. Or it will ring a half hour later informing me of a message received when I have another call. I hate this phone so much. Sometimes when it does not allow me to call out I will open up the battery back and reinsert the sim card then it all of a sudden works or I will hit it against my hand and it will work. This Phone is a curse do not get it. My coworker has this phone and she has the same problems. I can't believe I paid $129. on this dam phone.
