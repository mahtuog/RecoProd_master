I just realized that I have the S710 not the S710 VOX. Everything else remains the same.I have never written a review but I hate this phone so much I had to write it, I take care of my electronics and I am so angry that I have this phone. I bought this phone about 5 months ago. Let me list the reasons why this phone is the worst tech investment ever:1. Sometimes my mail downloads, sometimes not.2. When it does download, sometimes the whole message downloads, sometimes it downloads partially although my settings are for the full message.3. And now i am getting an error message about low storage space that pops up every few minutes even though i have deleted almost everything on the phone.4. This phone is a POWER HOG! One minute its fully charged, the next hours, maybe not even a whole day it's dead. And I have power saving settings on.5. If you enter 3 numbers for the same contact, the name shows up 3 times, not just once w/ 3 numbers connected to it.6. I e-mailed HTC tech help DAYS ago about the memory alert and I have not gotten any response yet.AND I know someone else who got a touchscreen HTC at the same time that I got this phone. His touch screen already has stopped working. And he also takes care of his phone.I just want to trash this phone with a bat but it costs $400.00! Although this phone has nice features, it is not easy to use and for the hassle that it is, it's not worth the money. HTC is not ready for prime time! Instead, get a blackberry, an i-phone, get a wire and two cups... anything else but an HTC. Or you'll be very sorry.
