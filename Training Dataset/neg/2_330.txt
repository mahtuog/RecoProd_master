I ordered this item for the purpose of transferring pics to the comp. After ordering I found out that Verizon (who I have) makes it impossible to transfer pics using phone tools. (Not sellers fault)I refused delivery when it came. I've been trying since May 9 to get refund from BargainCell. After SEVERAL emails, them saying they don't have the item, tracked the item myself for them, saying my address is unreliable, (all I did was refuse delivery, not move) finally was notified May 28 that I'd get refund. Never again with this seller.
