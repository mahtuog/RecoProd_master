I ordered one of these phones in December '06; it was defective right out of the box. Returned it and got another, which worked fine for a month. Then the phone would not charge when plugged in. Instead it gave me an "Unauthorized Charger" message, even though I was using the factory charger. Verizon would not exchange it even though the phone is supposed to have a one-year warranty. Check online on cell-phone forums and you'll find this is a common problem with RAZRs.
