It charges my Treo 700w faster than the wall charger or my iGO universal adapter, but still has the following glaring problems:1) Squeals loudly when in a charging state2) Interferes with AM radio reception while charging3) The connector quickly developed a problem with intermittent contact to the phone. Unless the phone is sitting at the right angle, contact is not made properly, and no charging occurs. this is annoying since the phone tends to bounce around a little in my truck, and I have to insert the phone upside down into my cup holder to maintain just the right angle with the charging cord.All in all, I wish I'd spent more money on a better quality charger. The build quality of this unit seems good, but the performance is poor.
