I bought this transmitter so that I could play audio from any device I'd like to while in my car, mostly music off of my Droid Razr. In buying the Monster brand I was expecting a solid product, but I haven't been fully satisfied. I am able to get decent, though often static laced sound most of the time I use it. Other times I have trouble finding an unobstructed radio station to transmit through and the device is useless. I would try other options before settling on this product.
