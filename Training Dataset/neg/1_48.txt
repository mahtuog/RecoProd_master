I received these and they were defective. Months later, the company has continued to dodge me and still has not processed my refund. Their shipping costs are 6 times what it cost me to return them for no refund. Amazon, where are you to remove CMMA Accessories ? Don't let their 3 or 4 star overall rating fool you !
