Initially, this was the best FM transmitter I ever owned. My first one lasted 5 years before it stopped working (though it consumed two AAA batteries every month). The other worked fine, but the signal strength was relatively weak, and so there was a lot of background static. This one worked wonderfully. The audio was as clear as you can get with an FM transmitter, and I never had to worry about static.And then, after 3 months of owning it, the connection between the car plug and the transmitter itself basically stopped functioning. If I wiggled the wire around a bit, the transmitter would power up, but only for a few seconds. The only way I could get it to stay on was by putting constant pressure on the part of the wire that touched the transmitter. Even then, it eventually stopped responding even to that. Now it does not function at all.If you are willing to take the risk that the transmitter will work properly for as long as you want it, then this is a great product. But if durability is important, you might want to find a different FM transmitter.
