With the rubber ring in place the head set does not seat well in the gels and comes out too easily. With the ring off it will barely stay in the small size. The medium gels fit me best until they are stretched by the rubber ring. One gel even split wen trying to put the earpiece back in. I am trying the small for now until I find a better solution.
