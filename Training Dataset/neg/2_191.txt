I have always liked palm products. We use them in our business and they do save us a lot of time. I purchased this product to save myself from having to carry a palm and a phone.The good:Very loud ringer.Plays MP3's with a mini sd card and free player ava on download.com.Nice looking and feels well made when holding it in your hand.Uses Palm software for 100's of software titles.Keyboard is easy to use.The Bad:No properly functioning alarm clock. One can be purchased for $20!!!Has a huge delay when answering a phone call for the caller to hear your "Hello"Case is "slick" and is easy to fall out of your hand when talking.Charging system is junk. Broke 1st day It arrived.If phone falls just right it is broke beyond repair.I truly loved this phone but it just is not a real business phone. It does what it is supposed to do, but can not stand up to the slighest drop or "real world" hazards. I have an el-cheapo phone that has been through a war and still works and cost $49. For the original price of this I would expect the same. I would recommend buying another phone, as the quality is really bad.
