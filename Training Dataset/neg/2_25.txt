Received case well packaged and fast shipping! The case itself form fits phone fine, but does not snap well together. The first time I tried one of the top tabs broke. So for temporary purposes until I get a new case I used a dab of Gorilla glue to hold the upper two halves together. Obviously if I have to reset the phone this will be the end of the case. Only 3 bucks, but I would put that money towards a soft silicone case.
