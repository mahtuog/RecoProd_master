The second day after I got this phone, it wouldn't turn on. I had to exchange it for another one. Now, four months later, the end key doesn't work and turns off every time I plug in my handsfree.I called T-Mobile, they said they were going to send me a replacement. They did, but they failed to tell me that it was a refurbished model. It had dirt in the keypad. I had to vacuum it but it's still dirty.I went to a T-Mobile store and was told that they discontinued the T722i because there were so many returns due to defects.
