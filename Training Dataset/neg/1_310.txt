Amazon rebate is a scam. I purchased this headset on 1/23/2007, and received it on 1/25/2007. However, the RebatesHQ site was not functioning on 1/25/2007. When it works the next day, it can not locate the offer number, nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture. If you click on the URL link supplied by Amazon Rebate form, you will be able to find the offer by Amazon order number, however, they will disconnect you in the next step saying 'session expired'. There is no way around, what a scam. It's a shame for Amazon to squeeze the last penny out of its customers. It's $5.99, come on!
