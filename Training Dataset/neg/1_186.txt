I bought this headset with the hopes of being able to use it as they advertised. I was reallying wanting to use it with my phone for conference calls and with my computers for music and gaming. Addtionally I wanted to use Team Speak and Skype with it. I have yet to be able to connect the headset to any computer and I have tried 4 different bluetooth dongles all with different modes of failure. I can listen to music using the adapter that was included, and I can use it with my phone. However if I go to my phone with it I generally have to turn the headphones off to reconnect back to my music.The sound is pretty good and they are comfortable. People do mostly report having really good sound on thier end of the phone with them.I would never buy them and I would urge anyone consdering them to wait until somebody comes out with something that works.
