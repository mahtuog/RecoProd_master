The prime selling feature of the Jabra line of headsets is the &quot;earbud,&quot; a soft rubber cap that is anatomically designed to fit in the ear. The problem is, the earbuds don't stay on the units securely, so once they fall off, you're stuck with a headset that doesn't stay in your ear and you've just wasted your money. I lost my earbud the first day I used the headset. Why? Because the soft rubber earbud easily snags onto pocket linings, collars ... everything ... and when it does, it pulls loose from the headset and falls *silently* onto the floor. I replaced the earbud and tried securing it with Elmer's glue, and then later, rubber cement. Nothing works. The only way to positively not lose the headset is to leave it in your ear from the moment you wake in the morning till you go to bed at night --- not very practical! Skip this product and save yourself some money and aggravation.
