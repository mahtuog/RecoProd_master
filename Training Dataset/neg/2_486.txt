I get in and out of cars and planes a lot and broken clips are the fate I must live with. Taking it off the belt when sitting down seems to be the method to keep the clip from breaking when I remember to do this. I ordered a rubber case along with this new one so I can chose a pocket carry option. Clipping the thing to my briefcase seems to work for getting in and out of the car. Like the others I agree the clip is junk, but it is plastic so I can't expect it to take my 6 foot frame bending the thing over when I'm getting in a car.
