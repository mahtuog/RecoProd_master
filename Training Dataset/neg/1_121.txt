It's cute and light-weight. However, I've only had about 3 phone conversations that were not very choppy or down-right incoherent and dropped. We bought 3 of these for our family and they are almost always unusable. There is an echo in one of them. We have had 4 other phones, mostly Nokias, and they all served us very well. These are going back. Hope you don't wind up with one. In shopping for a replacement, ALL the sales people say that they are getting a lot of these phones back. They have a horrible reputation. I'm glad to read that some people are not having problems with theirs, though.
