Don't spend your money on this device. Mine is recently out of warranty and the battery is a problem. Even though there are replacement batteries for sale on the internet and instructions on how to replace the batteries, neither Sprint nor Palm will perform that service. The only explanation I can think of for this lack of service is an attempt to force an expensive upgrade.
