The cord on the Jabra is about two feet too long and no clip is provide for the cord, so it must be coiled up in a pocket if you carry your phone on your belt to keep it out of your way. None of the 6 ear buds included fit very well, the unit sticks out of my ear too far, and people on the other end of phone calls tell me the sound quality stinks.
