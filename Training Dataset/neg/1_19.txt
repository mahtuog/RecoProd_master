great idea the issue is some people (me) dont have the "flap" that these fit into on my ear, the top piece needs to be at least 5mm longer to fit without falling out. the teacup ear bud works better.and since i opened it i cant return it way to go amazonif your ears dont have deep folds do not buy these.
