The V3m is a great phone that Verizon has crippled. The camera can take 1 megapixel images that get locked into your phone unless you subscribe to the optional text and image plan. As others have noted, if you wish to download images directly from the micro sd card, you have to remove the battery to take out the card. You can't download images from the phone with a usb cable.After many hours of trying, I was able to download music using a Windows XP machine with Media Player 10, which I never use for music. I prefer iTunes, but it will not work with this phone. The Verizon interface makes it awkward to use the music features and you will need USB headphones for additional money (again).While my older Motorola phone was able to use Verizon's national access to connect my computer to the internet (14.4k with no additional charge except minutes used, slow but useful), the V3m has disabled this feature and requires you to subscribe to a data plan for... more money (again).In theory, voice dialing will allow you to use a voice command to call any number in the directory. It hasn't been perfected. If you say, "call Mary", the phone is just as likely to call Harry.Although Verizon boasts about their network, this phone has been unable to connect in transportation hubs like New York's Grand Central Terminal and Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport. Battery life is weak and the ring tones are lame but you can always get new ones from Verizon for... more money (again).It is clear that Verizon has engineered this phone to squeeze every extra dollar out of you that they can. You have an option. You can just say no to the V3m and get an iPhone.
