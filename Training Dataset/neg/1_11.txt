These may work for some people, but for others like me, they're worthless. The fit was horrible and they did not stay in my ear. They also caused my Jawbone Prime to protrude far enough so that the front part no longer touched my face (which is required for their noise reduction circuitry to work). I threw these away and am now using the stock earbud with the ear hook.These are designed for people with a certain ear shape. If your ears don't conform to this shape (which is likely the case for many people), these will be useless. If you want these, I suggest buying from a local store where you might be able to try them on, or at least to return them without having to pay return shipping.
