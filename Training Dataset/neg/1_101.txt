First, I hope no one reading these reviews is considering actually paying for this thing. I think that you shouldn't even take it for free, for two reasons: 1. you'll be paying a bundle a month for a service you can barely use, and 2. you probably passed up another free phone that no matter how bad it is, has to be better than the LG 1300.My major complaint is dropped calls. (The battery life is a little thin, but I would say not a major problem.) But it's really tough to have a conversation more involved than "when are you getting home?" "seven." "okay, see you then." because you will spend half your time saying, "wait, can you say that again?" The reception is awful (/with/ the new antenna) even when the phone doesn't drop calls. Plus, the sound quality is really poor, and as other people have said you have to grind the phone into your ear to make out anything the other person is saying.DO NOT take this as a free phone as I did - ANYTHING would be better. If you have the choice between this phone and a cardboard box with numbers written on it, choose the box. At least you can keep photos in it.
