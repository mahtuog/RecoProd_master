I initially purchased this phone through Verizon: A brand new Razr. It looked nice, but the battery on the phone was worthless. Every night I had to recharge the phone. Even when I did not use the phone all day, I still had to charge the phone at night. Same thing happened after exchanging the battery. I tried three different batteries, but same result. Maybe I had a defective phone, but that did not matter to me. I simply exchanged the phone after seven days to another model. I would not get this phone if I were you. Hope this helped.
