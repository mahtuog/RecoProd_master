I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, because I wanted a simple phone that is light, tri-band, and with a decent battery (up to 2 weeks standby time nowadays is quite reasonable).The battery in standby didn't last more than 3 days, and if you turn off the phone to recharge the battery, the screen becomes totally dark: it is then impossible to know whether the phone is recharging, or whether it became fully charged, which I've never seen with the other Nokia phones!If these characterstics are generic, then get rid of it A.S.A.P.!!!!
