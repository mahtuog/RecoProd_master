I have had this phone for about a year now. And my happiness with it has gone downhill since day one.First of all, the reception seemed to get worse and worse. Now its to the point I cannot wait for my contract to end so I can get a new one. And when I talked to the t-mobile guys in the mall, they said that this phone is known to have crappy reception. Coulda used that info a year ago.Second, its way way way too quiet. Even at full volume, it will not even come near comparing any moderately new phone out there (namely the motorola V300 and V600 that my girlfriend and roommate have, respectively). This becomes very annoying if you aren't hiding by yourself in a box where it is very quiet. But you won't have to worry, because you won't get strong enough reception to make a call anyway, whew!Minor things. The phone is easily scratched. After 11 months, 60% of the time when I press the 6 key, it punches in two 6s which is real nice. Battery life doesn't really last more than 3 days under less than average use (I use like 200 or 300 of my min a month, tops). Camera is blah, screen is too small. Did I mention the reception is really bad? Cuz it is.This phone was great when I had free t-zones, but T-mobile took them away from me. :-( It was the only thing I was enjoying on my phone.BTW, as far as my other friends have noticed, no one has issues with T-mobile service here in East Lansing, MI.So, if I can tell anyone reading these things one thing, spring the extra few bucks for a flip phone from anyone but Sony. Seems I have gotten what I paid for. Oh well, live and learn. Hopefully the V300 treats me better
