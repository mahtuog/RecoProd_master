I bought this case with the expectation of clipping it to my belt or bag, making my phone more accessable. It fit where I wanted it but it's very hard to get it off quickly. I have missed several calls because I can't get it unhooked quick enough (but that could just be me.) I'm passing it on to a family member who liked it.The velcro-secured cover also gets caught in my hair and gets in my way when I am in a hurry. It doesn't prevent me from accidentally pushing buttons on the phone, but that may just be my fault. I won't buy another for me but I will probably buy one for my husband, if I don't find one I like better.
