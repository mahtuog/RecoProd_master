I've had two of these, and both have broken in the same way during the course of normal wearing and use.The way the headset adjusts for head size puts pressure on the plastic sleeve holding the midpiece in place... this plastic is thin, and eventually breaks under the stress.At that point, the sleeve can't hold the midpiece in place, and the earpiece/sleeve is able to fall freely... the only thing holding them together now is the wire that runs between each earpiece.Additionally, the end of the midpiece sticks out where the plastic sleeve used to be, and one can no longer slide it back in easily as it gets caught up instead of being held in place.This is a serious design flaw that never should have gotten through product testing. The Pulsar 590 should be remanufactured, and free replacements sent to those who purchased the flawed versions.Any class-action lawyers looking for a case?Don't buy this headset unless you want to be trying to return it in a month or two.
