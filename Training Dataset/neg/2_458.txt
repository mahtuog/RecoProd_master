Good:1) Connectivity options, connects via bluetooth, IR, and WAP.BAD:1) This phone is supposed to pick up what ever signal it gains, instead of telling me there is no network. I guess this phone comes with network lock and does't look for other carriers.2) My old phone used to pickup the signal strongly, but this one doesn't.
