I had mine 30 days before I heard the sound of plastic snapping as I sat down. The problem is that the belt clip pin is not locked in place and over a very short time it works itself free on one end. The next thing you know, the hard plastic is breaking. Glue fixes the problem, but within two weeks of use, the action repeats. Buy something else!
