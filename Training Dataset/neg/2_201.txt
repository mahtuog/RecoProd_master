I found the earpiece, which is adjustable, to be comfortable and clear sounding. However, in conversations with others on the phone (and test messages to myself), I was barely audible at a normal conversational volume to both the other party on the line and voicemail.It seems to me that the microphone (which supposedly features noise canceling) is either too short for its intended purpose or is not sensative enough. I recommend another product that allows you to hear and to be heard.
