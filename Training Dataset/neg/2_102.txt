I loved the idea of wireless for the convenience and safety and was loving the Jabra until it fell apart on me. The distance from your headset to the cell was definitely short range, maybe a few feet away before it got fuzzy. What was worse is that after 4 months of owning it, the earpiece (that holds the rubber plug) broke off and the headset surface started fading. The piece breaking off meant I could not put a earplug on there and it was not covered in the warranty (the customer service suggested I super glue it!) I bought another Jabra thinking the last one was a fluke...but other things started falling apart. Very poor quality piece...I would rethink buying this product!
