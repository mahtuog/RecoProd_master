many bubbles in casing...phone keeps demanding i install a sim card that was not received...best of all, the charger is european, not american...co. rep has offered to work with these "issues" but i do not expect them to repay the time and $30.00 it cost to replace the charger, and i do not have the time to waste trading the phone for one that is not marred.
