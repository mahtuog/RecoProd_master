I have CDMA version and battery life is short even not using games, the color display looks faded, its case looks cheap and fragile, buttons don't work well (sometimes you have to force them), there's no software for downloading from PC, so every little thing you want to load on the phone (ringtones, wallpapers, etc) you have to pay for. Not even want to mention the camera...Pure waste of money.
