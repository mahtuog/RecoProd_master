I am a longtime Blackberry user and was hoping this keyboard would help when typing long emails on my iPhone5. I couldn't get used to it and ended up just not using it at all. The tiny keys are lined-up in straight columns, too close together and the space bar is too narrow. It could have been much more useable if they hadn't tried to tried to cram so many functions into such a tight space. Give me just the basic alpha keys with function keys to get special characters and I would have been much happier.
