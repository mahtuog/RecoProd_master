Quality Construction, but to stiff. Hard to get phone in and out. I have purchased a previous Cell Case from Amazon that was a Nicole Miller. It was soft leather and approximately same size. I love it. Have never used this one, sits in a drawer. I use Cell cases daily for work as a property manager. On the go constantly and must keep hands free. Cell phone a tool not a fashion statement.
