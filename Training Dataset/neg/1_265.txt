DO NOT buy this phone unless you're willing to endure continuous calls from Verizon Wireless if you try to close your account.Last week, shortly after telling Verizon's sales person I was switching to T-Mobile because their Customer Service is a disaster, I began getting three to five calls each day that hang up as soon as I answer. Doing a *69 revealed they were coming from 1-800-470-0768, Verizon Wireless' number. Calling a supervisor (Jasen) resulted in an apology and him putting me on their Do Not Call list, which he says won't take effect for 30 days. He also said this is a "known problem with Verizon's auto-dialer" for which Verizon has no solution. It's only noon and so far today I've gotten three calls from them, two hangups and another sales pitch to upgrade my phones and stay with Verizon Wireless.I'd rather stick needles in my eyes.
