I think this is a great phone. It's pretty neat. But it is very much a "made in China" phone,m so the quality seems a little poor. But the only that I couldn't stand was the poor reception it has. Sometimes, it goes into "emergency call" only mode because it can't pickup my provider (AT&T) which I usually have great signal in my area.
