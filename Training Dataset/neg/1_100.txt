Where to begin?I've had the charging problems that others have mentioned. Also, the phone sometimes just turns itself off. Very convenient when you're expecting an important call. The external LED isn't even mentioned in the user's manual. It's there purely for decoration, apparently. The software on the phone is of a generally clunky quality. I can get to the Ringtones shop in one click, but if I miss a call, it's 3 or 4 clicks to check for the caller's identity. You can see where Cingular's priorities are...The one mitigating factor I'll mention is that the reception has improved greatly since I installed the new antenna that I was sent by Cingular.Next time, I'm buying a Nokia or a Samsung.
