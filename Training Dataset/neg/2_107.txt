I bought this cable. My first peeve was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable, but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place, so WATCH OUT, and treat this cable nicely. I like the retracting cable concept, but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged.
