After three months of reading reviews about FM transmitters in general, I decided to give this item a try. I wasn't expecting CD quality, but if it performed at cassette tape or maybe radio quality it would be adequate. Within an hour, I had reached the conclusion that FM transmitters are a dismal option to playing your mp3 player or phone's music through the car speakers.Reasons:1) You have to find a frequency that is clear of ANY broadcasting for it to work at all. The radio dial has a few stations that are listenable, but also has many stations which have static in the background of the programming. This won't work.2) While driving, different stations come in or fade out making your presets useless unless you drive only within bicycle riding distance and stay there.3) You have to keep rescanning, while you're driving, because your preset signals deteriorate with the fade in/out of stations.4) There can be alot of static while listening to your phone's music. This could be because the transmitter is too weak to reach from your cigarette lighter to the car's antenna. I had to hang the wire on the turn signal switch to get a better line-of-sight from the FM transmitter to the car antenna which was about 4 feet away.It's a nice idea but the implementation just isn't there, for FM transmitters in general.Since then, I've found a more elegant solution that is also affordable. It's a wire that you plug into the back of your car stereo. You then run the other end of that wire out of the dashboard to wherever you'd like. This end has a 3.5mm jack that will serve as the auxilliary input found in all modern car stereo units.There are videos on the net that can show you how to get behind your car stereo. Then, just plug this cable into the back and done. You have an auxilliary input which will let you plug in your music player or phone and play cd quality sound over the car speakers.
