I received a model, not as pictured. The vendor offered me a refund, but after shipping both ways, it's not the wisest decision. I was better off just keeping it.The sound over the FM was heavy in bass and not enough treble. The model I received was not the Full Spectrum, but instead, the model that offers just a few frequencies. I am not happy with this product, but in all fairness, the Monster RaidoPlay I received was a different model than the one I ordered. I will attempt to purchase and try from a local retailer soon.
