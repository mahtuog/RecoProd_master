the unit fits me quite well, the incoming sound is clear and loud, and the on/off feature is cute. But, according to almost everyone that I have called using this accessory, it is very diffcult to hear me. i cant figure out what the problem is...maybe they cut down its mike sensitivity to eliminate extraneous sounds...anyway, they need to figure out what many others have suceeded in, that being to get the mike to be sensitive enough to pick up voices efficiently.the styling is nice, and have had no quality problems. but, I just cant make myself heard.
