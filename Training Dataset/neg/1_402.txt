My favorite thing about this phone is the ability to use &quot;In Da Club&quot; as my ring tone. Unfortunately, that's all I like.For the first 3 weeks, it's fine...Then everything falls apart. The screen turns off, the antenna falls off, it switches to analog mode for no reason, the battery dies faster than most non-viagra users and the WORST thing is its refusal to charge. This piece of junk is so temperamental, you have to plug it in 12-17 times in order to get it to charge. Then 1-3 times a week, it will wait until you fall asleep, THEN stop charging - leaving you with a useless paperweight for your long day at work. And forget about replacing it, I've had 7 in the past year and they ALL fall apart. Plus, your wireless provider will pull some crap about &quot;warranty periods&quot; and &quot;upgrade charges&quot; even though your *most recent* phone is only a month old. Stay Away...far, far away.
