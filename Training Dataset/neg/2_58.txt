I have owned this phone about a month and I've had to take it back to the store 2 times already. The first time the phone "pretended" like it was charging but remained only @ 1 bar after charging for 12+ hrs. The second time the phone would drop my calls after about 3sec. of talking. The phone is very small and cute and the ringtones sound really good, but that's about the only thing redeemable about the phone.
