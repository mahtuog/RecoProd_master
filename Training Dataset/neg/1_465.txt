My wife and I recently upgraded phones to the Nokia 6555. As usual the headsets from the old Nokia's wouldn't operate in the new ones. After researching prices for the exact (supposedly) Nokia earbub headsets, we settled on two of these sets. Shipment was FAST, however neither worked in either of the phones. I think we paid $2.95 each, with shipping it was around $ 17.00. I did'nt even bother to return them ( I should have), but I just figured that we nearly got our money's worth. Next time I will go for the higher priced set.
