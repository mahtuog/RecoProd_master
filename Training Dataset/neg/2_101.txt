I have had thins headset for several months now and have to confess I hardly use it. I bought it for my T-Mobile telephone and while pairing was easy, when walking down the street the microphone seems to act like a wind tunnel - wind just blows straight into the microphone and no one can hear me over the combination of street noise and wind.I don't think it is a T-Mobile GSM issue although the microphones on their handsets seem to be so super sensitive that listeners often say they can hear my footsteps and the conversations of others around me better than they can hear me.Overall, not very workable and I'm disappointed. Have actually just ordered a Plantronics M3500 which boasts a noise-canceling microphone. We'll see if there is any improvement.Finally, I thought that at least I'd be able to use this headset for Skpye. It works a charm on my Mac although people say I'm faint, but on my Windows machine I am completely unable to get the sound to come out of the Jabra earpiece; only through the speakers on my computer. While that is better I think than having to listen to a telephone conversation through stereo headphones (which, incidentally, is unbearable and cuts you off from everything going on around you), it is not perfect.
