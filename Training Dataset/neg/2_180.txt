I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke, Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller.Unfortunately, this one is not comfortable at all. I agree with others that after 30-45 minutes, it feels like your ear is in a vise. It's true. It hurts.Sound quality is very good. People say they can hear me just fine, and I can hear them just fine.But it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use. What good is that? Then when the phone rings, I don't hear it.Then the clip broke on this one as well. Logitech again replaced it. But how long will this one lsat?Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
