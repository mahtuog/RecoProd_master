This was the exact item I had been looking for and could not find in the stores where I was shopping. I read other people's reviews that said how much they loved it. Only one said they didn't. I couldn't wait to get it. Well the love quickly died. I had trouble with the ear pieces. One seem too big and the next size seem too small. I could hear people great, but they had trouble hearing me. They said I sounded far away. I let my wife use it and I listened to her and sure enough she didn't sound all that great. Major disappointment. Maybe it works for some people but not for me.
