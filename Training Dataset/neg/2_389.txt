This is a vehicle power charger FOR a Motorola V170, V171 phone, but it's not a Motorola product. More importantly, the charging tip is different from the real thing. This charger has one charging zone of 6.3 volts whereas the Motorola charger has a two zone tip that delivers 2.6 volts in one zone and 6.3 volts in the other. The socket in the V170 is made for two seperate circuits which seem to need different voltages. This charger fits into the socket, but delivers the same voltage to both circuits in the phone. Does it work? I'm not going to risk trying it.
