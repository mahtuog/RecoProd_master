I am really mad! I was impressed with the looks of the phone and the Motorolla name; after all they invented the cell phone. But Moto is going the way of GM, to the brink of bankruptcy and they deserve to lose us - their customers. The phone quality is unusually bad. The worst thing is the very short battery life. You must have a charger in the car or anywhere you go. If you are in a place of no reception (inside a large building) the phone dies in 4-5 hours. If you have good reception, the phone would live for 1-1.5 days. But wait, that's not all. The camera is so bad it is useless. Fuzzy and dark. Besides, there is no way to download the pix anyway without letting Verizon rip you off. But wait, that's not all. The phone has music capability but you cannot use it because battery life is too short. Though anyway, no musing without paying Verison rip off money. But wait, that's not all. The software is so full of bugs it is simply unfinished. For example, if the alarm goes off and you are not there to stop, it will go until the phone dies. Normal phones stop after a minute. The calendar is also very "buggy" to use. Voice recognition is a also a waist of time.The one and only good thing is the GPS, but this is not specific to Motorolla and costs $10 per month.To summarize, avoid Motorolla and forget Verizon.
