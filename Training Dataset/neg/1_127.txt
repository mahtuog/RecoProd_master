The phone description says it is a quad band phone, but the one I received was tri-band (900/1800/1900). This international version does not work everywhere I need it to work. I have AT&T service (3G) and it works in NYC, where I work, but it did not work in upstate NY. The network in upstate NY switches from 3G to EDGE. If it had 850 band, it would have worked. The phone itself is a decent phone, but if doesn't work, it doesn't matter. Amazon's description is not accurate, so if you need a quad band phone beware of this phone. You might be better off getting a US version instead.
