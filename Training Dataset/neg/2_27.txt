Not the greatest produce. I have used the product for about 3 weeks and just recently took it off. The cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which I had to cut bigger. It attracts lots of lint from your pockets. I just haven't really been pleased with it. But for as cheap that it was, I shouldn't really complain.
