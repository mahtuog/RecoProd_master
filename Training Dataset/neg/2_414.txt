The phone comes with many fancy features as documented, and it is sure deserved many many positive comments. I like to say something as a fundamental phone user.I bought the phone during the Amazon promotion and I was using Sprint-PCS and I switched to T-Mobile solely for the new phone. Before acquiring the phone/service, I read all the reviews about this phone, it seems that so many people gave 5-star positive reviews, and it was convinced that I won't be wrong. Truly, it comes all those cutting-edge features, but in term of its fundamental feature as a phone, I am not happy at all: The reception power is weak (not even average). People may argue the signal in my area, all I can tell is My wife uses another T-Mobile phone - the Motorola V66 phone (tiny only 2.8oz, supposedly a cheap one), she can make a call where I cannot. The reception is even worse in a moving car.Many reviewers had rated it one-star or two-start because of its poor reception power - I wish I had more attentions to theirs.Another issue with the fundamental feature as a phone is that, I have no way to record a &quot;dial pause&quot; (commonly use the # key). For example, I like to record a calling card number (dial a number first, then a pin number after a 20-second pause), or check with corporate voicemail, I have to punch in the pin-number every single time.The review board reminded me of the last purchase I made for the Nikon Coolpix 950 Digital camera (I paid $750 on Amazon, one of my most regretted purchase), the reviews on the camera was overwhelming high (even up to now, 4.5 stars of 90). Now I am questioning that the Nikon Coolpix 950 is such a short-lived product due to issues (I guess one of the most unsuccessful products in Nikon Coolpix family), how can the ratings be so high?? The same to this Sony-Ericsson T610 phone, are five-star reviewers all truly users or what??
