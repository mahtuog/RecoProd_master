it has the most horrible service in all the land and is an upset because it breaks easliy my phone that i didnt have for half a year it broken and i cant buy a new one.but not only that it has the stupidest features ever.You cant get a good service in a basement or in a car.it studers and cancels your calls.not only that but tapes your recording after the call if you didnt press the cancel button.it has some wierd features in wrong places i would rather have a home phone that my phone.it makes you wait more than a minute for some features and dosent work right ever.
