I've had this phone for about 3 months now. It will NOT charge! I have tried many different outlets, but for the past few weeks, the phone won't charge. When it does charge, it doesn't hold a charge. I've heard of others having this problem as well. The phone is also slow. It doesn't go where you want it to go right away. The phone is awesome for a while, but then all of these problems start happening. I wouldn't buy this phone. I am going to pay the price to get a different one. I hate it.
