The fact that I am giving this phone a 2 star seems a bit unreasonable for the phone itself because I haven't really used it yet since I got it from Amazon. The phone is to ordered together with Cingular service and contract, which was what I did a month ago. The package arrived a week after I first ordered, without SIM card which is listed in the invoice. I went through the process of an exchange immediately by printing out the return label and dropping it off at a UPS store. A couple of days later, I got the bill from Cingular with first month service and activation fee, etc. I called cingular (multiple times) and cancelled the whole service. Then when I was emailing Amazon to get instruction, I was told that a second package, with the PHONE ONLY, is sent out and I MUST go to a Cingular store to purchase a SIM card and seek refund from Amazon. So now, a month after I ordered the phone and service from Amazon and a good number of emails back and forth with Amazon (who respond to emails more and more slowly), the status is that I have the phone, unusable (no SIM card), debating whether or not I should return the whole thing (and wait for 4-6 weeks for them to refund the money to my credit card) or go to a Cingular store as they proposed. Conclusion: never make complicated order like cell phone and service from Amazon because the customer service of Amazon through emails only is not customer friendly at all.
