I bought this a week ago (not from Amazon), hoping to replace an inexpensive, yet very functional, Samsung which I had lost the earpiece for.I'll get right to it. It charged and paired quickly and without incident. I'll also say that the piece that fits into your ear was excellent, as was the ear clip that was on a turning hinge that made it simple to get onto/into your ear. That's the good part. The problems were: An unusually high amount of static unless the phone was out of my pocket and in my hand near the Bluetooth unit. Don't even think about using the unit 30 feet away from the phone as advertised. Voice dialing was horrible; it recognized the names I was trying to dial, but when I said "yes" after it asked me to confirm the name, I had to say "yes" multiple times, and in fact, had to start the whole process again more times than not.I ended up taking it back to the store for a refund. So there you go; a lot of people seem to like it, but for me, it didn't work very well at all. Good luck to you if you buy it.
