OK, another electronics manufacturer has managed to make another cellphone. This time it meets Mil-Spec standards for drop kick and water resistance. Wow. All cell phones should meet this standard. Oh, all cell phones should also be free. Yes, that's right, they cost almost nothing to make and most importantly you are being charged astronomically by your cell company for the right to use the air you already own as a citizen. OK, I guess you are too young to remember walkie-talkies, but back to the product.A. All phones should meet this mil-spec. B. This phone is heavy. C. The camera is poor at best. D. If the other party talks quickly, you cannot understand them. E. The phone is putting out too much radiation and your ear heats up and therefore who knows what damage will be inflicted. F. It is the usual, stupid flip-phone so encouraged by cell-service providers because it does what flip phones with buttons on the outside are designed to do: It drops calls, shuts off the ringer, and generally causes you have a phone with the ringer turned off...and all this is a mission critical phone? This spells B-A-D in terms of reliability.
