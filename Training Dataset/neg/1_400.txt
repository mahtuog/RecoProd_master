Are u kidding me. This phone has made me think twice about using motorola phones. It does have good colors and stuff like that but there are more cons than pros. First of all, I have sent my phone back to Tmobile twice for a new one because the charger keep getting messed up. The camera feature is just more than atrocious. If u are not outside, u probably will not see anything o the screen. It is also an attachment which means that u cant take a picture of someone without them noticing. This is why a phone with a in built camera is nicer like Samsung and LG and Panasonic. I would tell anyone: Dont get this Phone...
