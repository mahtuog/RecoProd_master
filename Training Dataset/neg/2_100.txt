i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it, but what i didn't test out was the reception/range. i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it, EXCEPT for the fit. it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines. it fits great. it doesn't hurt. i can wear it for hours. it seems to have a ton of talk time (at least 6 hours, i would say)...but the reception just plain sucks. i don't know if it's all the electrical devices running in my apartment, but damn, i can't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me. you almost have to have the phone 1) within about 6 feet of you and 2) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra. basically, count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device! and your microwave. and your electric fans...and running water...they all make reception horrible. i think my problem might have been the wireless home network. but c'mon people, us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks. duh.summary:pros:*lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ($42 shipped for new)*easy to usecons:*range, range, range! this is a huge one for me. if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time, what's the point?*too costly at $80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit. you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say, it's for sale on ebay!
