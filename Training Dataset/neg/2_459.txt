I was very excited to get this phone. It looks and feels great. However, the phone is extremely quiet. Try having a conversation outside where cars are whizzing passed you and you cannot hear a thing. Using the Bluetooth headset renders the same problems. Also the phone will randomly crash on you and the keys stick after a few months use. I'm in the market for a new phone.
