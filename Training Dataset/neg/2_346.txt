I bought this headset for my Nokia 6102i. It was cheap($10) so I decided to give it a try. I had a hard time fitting the connector into the phone, but I did manage to get it in. The first time I tried it, I couldn't hear anything from the headset. The second time, I made sure to press the headset connector into the phone fairly hard, and then it started working. I found that just touching the connector will disconnect it from the phoneThe sound quality is just ok. I've tried another headset using a Nokia pop-port to 2.5mm universal adapter, and that headset sounds much better.Also, when using the pop-port to 2.5mm universal adapter, my 6102i phone recognizes the headset and displays a headset icon in the middle of the phone. The 2.5mm adapter also stays connected to the phone much better than the headset. I think this head just has cheap materials and construction. (How else could they sell it for $10)I decided to return the headset and use the 2.5mm adapter instead.Summary:Pros:1) Cheap(Only $10)Cons:1) Poor or just ok sound quality2) The headset doesn't stay connected to the phone very well.
