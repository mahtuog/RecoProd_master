I bought this Explorer 330, because I was so happy with the Plantronics Voyager 510. No two products could be more different in quality. True, this headset is much more sleek and modern-looking (the 510 does look a little like a hearing-aid), but it had a great range of at least 15 to 20 feet. This is not AT ALL the case with the 330. You will need to wear it on the same side of your body as your phone if you do not want to deal with unbearable voice distrotion and static. It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset. I will be returning mine and sticking with the 510.
