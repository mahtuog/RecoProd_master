Bought this otherwise fantastic product. Could not charge it ater a few weeks of use. Then got another one and could not charge it after a few weeks of use. Then they sent another one 3 days ago and it has just stopped charging.And when I call the customer service they told me that it was the FIRST time they heard someone having a charging problem with Plantronics 590a. Somehow I am having a hard time believing them. I feel they are getting dozens of calls each day.Any other readers - if you are having a similar experience - pl post your charging woes.Sad that this is an otherwise good product. But unusuable due to this problem. I recommend prospective buyers to hold off until these design flaws or fixed. Or a competitor beats them to it.
