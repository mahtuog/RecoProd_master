As a whole I would not recommend this phone to buyers.Yes, the phone is small, "cute" and has nice accessibility to volume buttons and there is a cameraHowever :- the camera has poor resolution- t-mobile reception is awfulin places where other cell phones with tmobile received one or two lines, mine had no signal.after leaving some place where there was no reception and going out into open air, the phone takes upto 1.5 minutes to pick up the signal (sometimes it works if you turn it off and then on again)many times when i change time zones, the cell doesnt pick up the new time and date.- the SOFTWARE HANGS!!the software is awful - it hangs at least once every 24 hrs and often times more.that's enough typing for now...i would suggest you look for a better phone...
