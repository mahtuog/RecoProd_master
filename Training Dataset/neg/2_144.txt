I had bought this as I wanted a phone that could take pictures, and it was advertized as being able to play mp3s, optional additional memory chip, etc. Sure, it is a decent enough phone, and build quality appears to be good, and it sure looks cool...those are the good features. For mine, I had to buy the phone tools software seperately(found at Amazon marketplace for 1$), in order to upload/download from the phone, and it cannot connect to the phone via usb due to driver issues. I have d/l drivers from motorola site and pc will never connect or even charge reliably, and sure cannot sync my contact list with it, guess I will have to send an hour entering the numbers manually. I never had issues with my old Nokia 6015 with this. Not a pc newbie. It just appears to be a lot of trouble to even bother with it. I am not using Verizon, but a small regional company. It is just a cool looking telephone only for me, and has me wishing I had done my homework better before ordering. The place to put the memory chip is inside the phone beneath the battery...which is pretty much a pain, too. The USB transfer rate is HORRIBLE, so much so that using it for mp3 player podcasts is useless...would take almost s long to transfer the files to the phone as to listen to them.
