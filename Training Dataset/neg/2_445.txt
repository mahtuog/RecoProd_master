The reason I say you could do better is that both Sony as a manufacturer and you as a consumer could do better.The phone doesn't get as good of reception as most Nokia or Motorola phones (on At&t; or Tmobile) and protective cases are both needed to cover the easily scratched/smudged screen and virtually unavailable. Same with handsfree, other than the ill fitting piece that comes with it only a bluetooth set is available adding at least another $60 to your bill.Sony usually means superior quality, but my girlfriends Motorola V300 was free after rebate and I'm jealous of it's quality over mine.
