I have been waiting so very long for a headset with technology that offers clean clear wireless reception, a headset that works with my computer, my home entertainment center, and my phone. A headset that flawlessly switches from listening to music / TV / PC / movies and answer an incoming call automatically -- yes the Plantronics Pulsar 590A is all that -- however the romance stops there.I received my 590's October 2005 for about $250CAN with shipping. Within the first month they developed a crack abut 1.5 inches long on the outside of the silver portion where the headband slides in for adjustments. Today 1may2006 I see cracks on both the inside panels or on the opposing side of the first crack mentioned.I was willing to live with one crack although concerned now though with three cracks these babies are going back to Plantronics!Further, I have treated these with extreme care and have never dropped them.Pros:Simply put they work as advertised with little to no playing around to get them to connect to other sources or devices.When talking with people they can actually hear what I am saying and I can actually hear them loud and clear (volume control works nicely here as well).Oh, and I love the blue light. Ya I'm a GEEK and proud of it!Cons:Very flimsy.Very Weak.Easily broken.Although the sound is clear and clean ie not all staticy -- THX they are not. Not even close.Plantronics! Build them and they will come!
