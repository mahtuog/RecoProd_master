This leather case is not very durable. After about 2-3 months of casual use (put it on and off my belt once or twice a day), the metal clip started to tear out of the back. Also, the clip is located too far down, so the phone protrudes more &quot;above&quot; the belt when it is worn -- this is very annoying because the antenna catches quite easily on a jacket or other clothing. Also, the clip's grip is quite strong (good, because the phone won't fall off), but it can be hard to put it on or off (especially when sitting down) if you clip it onto your belt. Also, the case does not provide any protection on the front part (the upper wing when unfolded) at all. On the plus side, the clear plastic cover does a nice job of protecting the keypad from dirt or moisture (when you talk). Also, the case will fit the phone with either the slim or the extended battery attached. (But if you switch between the two often, the case will expand and will feel loose with the slim battery attached.) Unless you are an extremely casual user or tend to put the phone in a purse, bag or compartment, I do not recommend this case at all. The plastic belt clip is a much more durable alternative for men (but probably less aesthetic or useful for women who don't wear the phone on their body or purse strap).
