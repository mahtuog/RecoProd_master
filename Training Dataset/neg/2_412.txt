Got the phone last week. Found out that when I am not on the network, callers can't reach my voice mail...tried it myself, and all I get is a busy signal.I had set the phone to automatic lock to avoid it turning on when in my pocket...worked well for two days, but on the third day the top four keys along with the joystick stopped working.Called up t-mobile and they said they would send a refurbised model for exchange :(But some of my friends have this model and it works fine for them...I am wondering if I was sent a refurbished model in the first place.
