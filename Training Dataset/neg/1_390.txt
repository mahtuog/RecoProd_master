The product works great--until it breaks, which is a couple of months after you buy it. I bought two. Both broke.purchase 1:(1) within a couple of months, the microphone no longer transmitted my voice (my callers couldn't hear me).(2) within a couple of months, the little speaker thing came loose from its casing.purchase 2:(1) in less than a month, the little speaker thing came loose from its casing(2) the part that you plug into the phone has got these little plastic tabs that hold it securely in the phone. One of those tabs snapped off in under a month's time, leaving the product useless.
