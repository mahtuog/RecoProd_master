It is a bad phone when it comes to performance. I had many phones (GSM and non-GSM; USA and abroad) in the past and this one rates lowest in performance.Signal reception is bad. I always hear some strange electronic flash noises. I was once told by a mobile phone company representative that this phone is not high on performance. I tested this phone along with some other brands from same phone provider (T-mobile) from two different locations (work and home). This one failed with a poor grade.Only feature I liked is the ability to sync contacts on this phone and Outlook contacts on laptop, wireless.No wonder they give $150.00 back on this phone. Looks like even phone maker wants to get rid of this from their warehouse!!!
