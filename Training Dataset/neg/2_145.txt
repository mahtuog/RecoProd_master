I used this piece for 5 months and now I DONT like it.. people just cannot hear me on the other end - the volume adjustments are a joke. The body is sleek and smooth. I dropped the phone once and the front screen has a big crack now.. The reception is not good. My husband has a sanyo phone and it works perfectly when my razor doesnt even catch the signal.. There is no ring+vibrate option, i miss that option.If you still want to buy it, buy a leather case and a blue tooth to compensate for the fragile body and bad volume and deal with the signal issues :)
