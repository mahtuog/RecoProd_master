When I bought this phone, I had read that the battery wasn't the greatest... I guess I figured I'd have to charge it every other day which didn't bother me... But nothing prepared me for how absolutely horrible it really is. If I talk for maybe 20 mins and listen to a couple of songs, this thing is down to nothin! (I had even set the packet data to "when needed" but it didn't help.)It's sad too because it would be a good phone otherwise. The style is cute with a little push button that opens the phone up, which I really liked. The sound of the little stereo speaker is really quite good. The reception is very good. And the format is very customizable (like most Nokias) if only the battery didn't drain like a leaky faucet!I can't recommend this phone and unfortunately I'm going to have to return mine. And since I have read that the 6555 is just as bad as far as the battery life goes, I guess this year will be the first time in about 10 years that I've had to use another brand other than a Nokia. Oh well, I guess it's time for a change!
