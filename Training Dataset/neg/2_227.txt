I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since. It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them. My biggest complaint is that there appears to be no way to go from high volume to vibrate noiselessly (each push of the volume button makes a beep). I loved that feature on my StarTac. Look elsewhere for a good flip phone.
