I have the LG C1300.. the design is good but it is too small, and that idle light i hate.. the ringtone quality is real tones & mulitimedia is ok and text is the very best.. it can handle text better than anyother phone that i have had. the battery when i talk on my phone in an average weekend it lasts me the whole weekend and i stay on the phone for a total of 42 hours in the eqlivent of text and net and that sort.. and the call quality is not really that all awesome some days i can call out and sometimes i cant cause the phone is weird and in a 5 bar place i cant call out sometimes and it has been doing that too me since i got the phone.. and my quote "ALL-in-ALL" opinon is be careful when you choose that phone there a more downs than there is ups with that phone. so i would like to say that i warn you not to get that phone..
