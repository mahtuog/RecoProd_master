My experience with the Explorer 330 has been mixed. On the positive side, under the best conditions the 330 has worked very well -- incoming and outgoing sound are far more clear than what I have been accustomed to with my BlackBerry 8830 cell phone.I have found, however, that the 330 performs poorly in several fairly common situations. First, background noise is a real problem. I have several times had callers hear nearby conversations more clearly than my voice, and car engine noise has sometimes drowned out speech. As another reviewer has already noted, the 330 is unusable in windy conditions.Second, battery life has been much worse than expected. As the battery level falls, the 330 needs to be closer and closer to the phone; otherwise, the person on the other end of the line will hear an unacceptable level of static, although the Bluetooth connection will remain intact. In general, I've found that after about two to four hours of talking time, the cell phone needs to be within an inch or two of the headset to function.Third, the 330 has a small effective range from the phone to which it is paired. In general, to have acceptable sound quality, I have had to keep my cell phone in a shirt pocket rather than a pants pocket or on a table in the same room. Again, this is closely linked to battery life; the 330's range is better if it is within its first thirty minutes after charging.All in all, this has been an adequate headset, but I have been frustrated by the number of situations in which it cannot be effectively used. In hindsight, I probably would not have made this purchase.
