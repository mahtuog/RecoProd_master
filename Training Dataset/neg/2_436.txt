This phone is unnecessarily complicated. The screen resolution sucks. The camera is virtually useless. Menu navigation is very cumbersome.The only good thing about this phone is, it gets you cash back. In short, I would not buy this phone again. I'm waiting for my contract to get over so that I can get better phone.
