When I talk to people using this headset they always complain about the background noise. Even if I am outside and there isn't any noise other than the wind, they can hear the crackling wind noise.I wanted to return the item, but I decided to keep it....just to use at home and in complete silence. But I was definitely dissapointed with the inability of this gadget to filter the background noise.
