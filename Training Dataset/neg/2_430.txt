I got this phone from Amazon with the expectation of crash free usage. However after about 3 months of using it the phone started to act funny. It would randomly drop calls, randomly turn itself off, and randomly freeze due to just regular everday use! The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is I can download wall papers to this phone otherwise I hate this phone with all my heart!!! I am going back to Nokia, at least I know I my phone will NOT turn off or restart in the middle of my conversation. I had gotten a replacement for this phone and the same thing is happening. This has got to be among the worst fully color phones out there. I'm calling them again to complain because it's garbage!
