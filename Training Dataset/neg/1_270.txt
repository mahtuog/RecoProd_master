This phone is a huge step down from the cheap old LG phone I got for free with my account ~3 years ago. Definitely avoid this phone entirely, or make sure that you get the updated software from a verizon store ASAP.Pros:- semi-slim profileCons:- 'slim' profile accomplished at expense of making phone wider another way- Glossy screen has massive glare and always appears dirty- Menu navigation requires many more button presses and extraneous submenues than my older phone for no apparent benefit- Annoying alerts for missed calls, messages, etc... will continue until you physically open the phone and respond to them- Software was only finalized about a month ago and requires that it be updated while physically connected to a Verizon store's computer- Phones have tendency toward battery and charger problems unless software is updated, as listed above- Poor reception and sound quality
