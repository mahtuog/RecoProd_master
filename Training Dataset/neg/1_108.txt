I renewed my 2 year wireless contract for the 2nd time last week and had decided to upgrade my phone. I've had 2 previous Nokia phones free with my plan. I really liked Nokia's performance, but my phone provider does not offer any with a flip phone style. Because I'm on the road a lot, being able to put a smaller phone into my pocket, briefcase, of handbag without dealing with locking and unlocking the keypad each time I used it is a real convience. I also wanted to get a stroner signal than I was able to get with he Nokia. I use a company provided Moterola Flip Phone that is newer than my Nokia and get a really great signal with it. I paid $50 for the LG C1300 phone. I was assured by the salesperson that the LG brand, although new, was in their experience performing well. This phone has only a fraction of the features my 2 year older model Nokia had, the signal is worse than any I've ever had and the phone is not very user friendly. Now unless I pay full price won't be able to upgrade again for 2 years and am stuck with junk. BUYER BE WARE! DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!
