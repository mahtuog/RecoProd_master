Absolute waste of money. What arrived was knock off crap that smelt like petrol and was slightly greasy/slippery to the touch.I left them sitting outside their packaging for a month so see if they improved but all they did was make the area smell like them.Given the price and cost to return not worth the trouble to send back however I would never buy from these guys again.Am fairly surprised at the comments of quality etc - suggest people go and see what the real thing looks/feels/smells! like in a retail store.
