I bought the Jabra for the express purpose of using it while my phone was 15-20 feet away on my desk. I experienced heavy static from that distance (despite an advertised 30 foot range). Also, when the side of my head with the Jabra on it was facing the phone, I got better reception than when I turned away. I am, apparently, thick headed.Using the Jabra in the car was an awesome experience, since the phone was so close to me. There were no wires to interfere with my driving, and I could answer calls easily with the Jabra itself, never even touching the phone.But $80 is too much to pay for wireless convenience in a car. Until the technology improves or price drops, the Jabra is just not as vaulable as a simple wired handsfree device. I returned my Jabra after one week.
