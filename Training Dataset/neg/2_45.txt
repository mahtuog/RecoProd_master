This accessory is limited by the microphone dangling near your face. This does not for clear transmission of voice and the complaint of listeners is too much background noise. To make the accessory really work well, you have to cup the microphone in your hand next to your face. In this case, you may as well put the phone next to your face since you are no longer &quot;hands-free&quot;. It would be better for Ericsson to create an adapter allowing a true headset with directional microphone that would be in front of your mouth. This would minimize background noise.
