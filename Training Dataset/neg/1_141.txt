I ordered a battery for a blackberry on October 30th. It didnt arrive by the estimated delivery time, so I emailed, and they asked me to wait until the following Monday. So I did, and still no battery! So I emailed again, and all they told me was that they have no control over the USPS, and would send me a new one. So now, I have to wait another 2.5 weeks to maybe not receive a battery again!Since I received the battery from the seller, I have had email after email demanding I remove this negative feedback from their site. I am NOT going to do this. They have badgered me over and over to remove it or, and I quote, "We've only just begun Steve. If you refuse to act with even a shred of decency or honor, I will make sure you regret it. Remove the negative tonight." This is the very email I received from SellPhoneStop customer service last night. I could be wrong, but why in the world would I remove my honest opinion if I believe I was given poor customer service?? Obviously, they are beginning to threaten me for my opinion. They really DO NOT care about their customers!! I will never, EVER, order from this company again, and I hope anyone who reads this, won't order from then either.
