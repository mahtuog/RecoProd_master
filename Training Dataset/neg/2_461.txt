Having previously been a Nokia customer, I thought I would try something different. This is a nice looking phone - but it's could easily have been so much better. For a customer mainly interested in using it for phoning and text messaging, this phone has an unfriendly menu. It almost seems like it is trying to make it difficult for you. Several features such as editing a contact or writing a text message can only be done if the menus are accessed from a certain way - for example, I cannot select someone from the address book and then choose to write them a message!! Why should I have to write the message first or reply to a previous message?I have also found on several occasions, that when I try answering a call when the keypad is locked, it diverts it to the answering machine. In the end it costs me since I then have to phone the person back. For the times you occasionally forget to lock the phone, the WAP button (a feature I never use) is conveniently the only feature that starts with the press of a single button - so it goes online while in your pocket.The photo quality is very poor - it might as well not have a camera. I uploaded a photo onto the phone so that I could have a decent background. Even if you do like photos - you cannot store very many (about 20 or 30). Annoyingly Sony Ericcson decided not to let you delete some of the pictures that came with the phone to free up space for more photos.Oh it does have one good feature - the quality of the reception. Admittedly this is important in a phone, but I expect most phones nowadays have good reception.Roll on October when my contract expires ...
