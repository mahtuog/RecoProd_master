I got this when I got a Nokia 6600 years back and while the Nokia 6600 lasted very well and I really liked it and I only had to replace it when the on/off button got spoiled after 5 years I found that I had little use for the car charger as I also had a spare battery with me and so it turned out to be an impulse buy with little use for me. However, it does work okay and if you are the kind who spends hours in your car then this may be very useful should your battery dies when you need it the most. Another thing I found about this charger is the rubber/plastic covering the wire is cheap and started to turn white and then flake off after a while making it useless after that. I guess you get what you pay for and for the price advertised one shouldn't expect too much quality although the Nokia name has been tarnished a little for having itself associated with such a cheaply produced item.
