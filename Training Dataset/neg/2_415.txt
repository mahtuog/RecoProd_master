I purchased this phone for its bluetooth connectivity and nice looks. It worked quite well in the beginning. There were some things I didnot like much but still it was usable.Things I like:1) joystick. it is well thought and pretty useful to do things.2) bluetooth, it is easy to transfer contacts, files from your cell phone to other cell phone or to your computer.3) color screen shows pretty crisp images.4) you can set a midi or mp3 file as ringtone. neat.things I didnot like about are:1) ringer volume is low. I used to hear my old cell phone (nokia 3390) ring from upstairs. You cannot hear this one unless you are in the same room.2) menu navigation could be better.3) camera is not so good. Don't think that you are getting a digital camera.4) keys are small, I had hard time not the press multiple keys.finally the problems I had recently, note that none of them were present in the first 3-4 months of usage.1) charging system is not durable, power adapter connection was made poorly. It disconnects while you are charging the phone, you came back 2-3 hours later to see your battery is still empty.2) speaker/mic is broken after 5 months of usage. Neither you, nor the other party hear anything. I will see about the the warranty coverage.3) pressing power button may not turn on the phone. I had to keep pressing it to get it to turn on.My final remark is to stay away from this one if you have comparable Nokia phone.
