I wanted to like this case; it feels like it should be sturdier than the OEM case, and it definitely looks more professional (though I'm not convinced that it's really leather). It is tight out of the box; the sock trick works well. The latch has a couple of big metal chunks that will probably wear through the liner and destroy your screen unless you get in the habit of turning the phone around (so it's less convenient to pull it out and use it). And mine broke after about 6 weeks of fairly lightweght use; the belt clip button detached itself from the case. It looks like the only thing holding it together was a little oval of double-stick tape.OK, what do you expect for eight bucks?
