Let me start off by saying that this is my 4th cell phone in 5 years, and this by far is the best phone I've ever owned. Phone is so ergonimically correct, and its touch wheel (similiar to that of the ipod) and buttons surrounding the wheel (also touch sensitive) work flawlessly and are amazing. You can set different sensitivity levels for the touch bad and buttons which is awesome. The feature that I enjoy most about this phone is the bluetooth. I purchased a platronics Voyager 510 (works flawlessly up to its advertised 30ft range) along with the phone and the two pieces of hardware are a match made in heaven. You can add a multitude of contact information to each phone number saved in your phone (email, fax, home, cell, work, picture, custom ringer -phone call, custom ringer -txt msg, place contacts into a group) and the screen display is top notch as well.Some Cons, the buttons along the side of the phone are a bit hard to press as they are indented into the phone as to prevent them from being pressed by mistake. Would of been nice of LG had put some single, double, triple tick marks on the buttons so that you could at least become familiar with the feel and function of the button. The latch for the charger and for the USB hookup seem a bit flimsy and I believe will ultimately break prematurely.Last thing, i didn't know that VCAST only worked in certain areas. If you're not in verizons ED-VO area of coverage then you cannot use the feature. I'm in Santa Barbara and I get no coverage, checked for other local cities...Ventura, Santa Maria, Thousand oaks and they are not covered either. However, Pasadena and Los Angeles are covered...not sure if that helps anyone but thought I'd through it out their.
