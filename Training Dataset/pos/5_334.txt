I bought this battery as a replacement for a weak battery in a Blackberry 8800. It was purchased from the Amazon merchant Webtreo. Delivery was prompt and the battery looks identical to the OEM battery that came with the Blackberry. I have been using the new battery for about three weeks without any problems. This appears to be an OEM battery at a fraction of the price I would have had to pay AT&T for the same battery.
