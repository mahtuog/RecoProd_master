I got this after i sold my BT200.. well i can say i'm not having the range issues as the people in the other review say..the only problem i have is that after leaving it a while it goes dead, even if it is off.. i dont know what its problem is but i have it sitting there and i dont know if its charging becuase the blue led isnt lit up :(
