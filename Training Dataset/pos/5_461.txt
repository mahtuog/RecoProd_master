The sound is good, considering is bluetooth. (doesn't compare with wired phones of course)The telescoping microphone works great, and the one touch call function works everytime.The fit is comfortable and thats sayin alot since my head is pretty freakin big.The range isn't anything spectacular if you are using these for your pc or laptop, but a decent usb dongle should solve that.All in all, i would recommend these to anyone who are looking for quality bluetooh headphones for your music and for your phone.The only thing is that these aren't that discreet, and the band can be snapped if your aren't careful.
