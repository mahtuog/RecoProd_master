This is one product that you'll wonder how you survived without it. It is very well integrated with the phone. Has antenna jack in cradle for external antenna (really needed in my area), automatic charger when you put the phone in the cradle, volume control on phone when talking is adjustable with the up and down buttons on phone, can control your car stereo to turn it off when phone in use, handset for private conversations.Note: 1) unless you are very technical, I would get a professional install -- f you want the phone to control the stereo, you'll probably pay extra because of extra contact relay required by most car stereo receivers. 3) For my cars (Chevy Tahoe and Chevy Silvarado Pickup) I had to buy an extra bracket to attach the cradle to the dash without drilling holes in the dash -- it attaches behind one of the seams in the dash. That costs ~20 more but is worth it so you don't have screw holes in the dash. 4) To control the car sterio, most receivers will need a contact relay (12V 30A, SPDT) to shut the receiver off and on. I wish that Nokia would just supply that part ... because it was hard to find (Radio Shack doesn't sell that particular part).I would definitely recommend this hands-free unit. The only thing bad about it was that the Nokia 5165 phone was basically free for me but the hands-free unit cost alot more ...
