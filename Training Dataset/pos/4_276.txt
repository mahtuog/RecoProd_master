I have bought 3 now in the last year. I need it, because I have a hearing aid, and this is the only way to use a GSM mobile hands free. But it is a little strange to act as a blue light. I needed 3, because the mechanical quality is very poor.I even was once stopped, driving in my car, by a police officer, that said the use of a flasshing blue light while driving was against the law.That is the reason I am now searching for a better one, of a competitor I presume
