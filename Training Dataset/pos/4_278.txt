Easy to link to both computer and telephone simultaneously. Computer audio cuts out when the phone rings. Works well with Skype. Comfortable to wear for extended periods. Audio adapter works very well with iPod. Sounds great.Not good at noise canceling on telephone calls in a car. Lots of background noise.
