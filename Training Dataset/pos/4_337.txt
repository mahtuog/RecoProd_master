I just upgraded from an older cell phone to this version.Motorola, I know, saw its market share diminish by not upgrading its phones. However, this particular model represents a major improvement for me.It takes a bit to get the functions straight (but, then, I'm a technophobe and not real techno-literate to begin with). However, I have been able to pick up the specifics and choose what options I wish (e.g., answering the phone by simply opening it). I was able to change ringer tones handily; it was easy to program voice mail; it was simple to access the web through the phone.I was even able to send my first text message (yes, I know, primitive).All in all, I'm pretty happy with this. I am well aware that there are much more powerful and fancier cell phones out there. But I prefer something simple and easy to use. And this fills my bill nicely.
