This is a great protective case for the Blackberry Pearl and I highly recommend it. But make sure you buy a protective screen saver too becasue the screen area is open. I don't use the belt clip, but it does come with the case, along with the other needed hardware to make the clip effective. I have received allot of compliments on this case and you can't beat it for the price.
