This story tops them all. I have dropped my Palm TX over and over with the Palm TX case. It's kind of banged up. The belt clip is kind of worn out. The springing thing won't hold it very well any more. The other day I got home from work and it was almost dark so I had to hurry and do some snowblowing. I heard a bump sound and didn't realize my Palm fell off the belt clip. I ran over it with my snowblower and it came out the shoot and hit the wall. I didn't realize it until I dug it out of the snow two days later. The TX was gaping open and the stylus was broken in half. I snapped it closed and the TX still works fine! Just had to get a new stylus. Weird, because my first TX died on me with no bumping around and I got this replacement one under warranty.
