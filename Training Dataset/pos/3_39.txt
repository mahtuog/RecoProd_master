I absolutely ADORE this headset. It fits snugly in your ear without being uncomfortable, stays in place, sounds great, battery life is fine for normal use all day long. It took the tiniest bit of work to figure out the thingy that curls up inside your ear. Although it looks like it would be extremely uncomfortable, you can't even feel it in there. There's nothing to wrap around the outside of your ear, so it doesn't bind and it doesn't interfere with glasses or sunglasses. It's so light it just floats there.So why 3 stars? My first one, the Bluespoon AX, lasted about a month then overheated while charging and wouldn't stay on anymore. But, I loved it SOOOOOO much, I went out and bought a second one, this time the AX2. It lasted about 2 weeks and did exactly the same thing.Why, oh why, did they finally make a headset that truly fits in my life, and make it so poorly that it won't keep working??????
