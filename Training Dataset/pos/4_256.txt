Overall, good headphones. I won't really comment on the quality of the audio, because it's so subjective... but I can say that I'm satisfied. Using headphones without wires simply makes you wonder why they all can't be this way; once you try them, the convenience is hard to beat.The battery life appears to be excellent for both the headphones, and the analog adapter (which you also have to charge, it's the transmitter for the signal.) On full charge, my iPod died before the headset+transmitter. Nice.However, there are two issues to be aware of. Using the adapter, there is an audio lag. It's about .5 seconds. This isn't noticeable with audio, but once you watch video... it's a problem. I have a video iPod and was disappointed with the lack of lip-synching. Strangely, the lag appears to be slightly variable... sometimes it's half a second, but when I mute the audio with the headset, then unmute, the lag appears to be slightly less. Always present, but variable. In any case, it's enough where you will not want to watch television or a movie this way.Since I also wanted to use the headset in my home, without disturbing others at night, it's a significant drawback.The second issue is cosmetic, and a nitpick. In use, the headset flashes a bright blue ring of light around the right earphone. It's very bright and practically screams "Look at me!"Not really my bag, but that might be your thing. ;)--Update (12/23/2006)The quality of the plastics/assembly has proven disappointing.After several months, some hairline cracks appeared, and shortly afterwards, pieces of plastic around the hinges started breaking off. Internally, pieces began rattling as well... and after a year, it would no longer charge unless you moved one of the headphone speakers around in a specific position. Finally, the left headphone just gave up. Terrible!
