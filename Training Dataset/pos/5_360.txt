this case is nice. for the price...i expected a cheap piece [...]. boy was i surprised. it even smelled nice and leathery new. i actually bought it for my nokia 6682. its a perfect fit. the case even has this little card holder. maybe u can put a credit card, business card, etc. its very nice. dont pay 30 dollars at the phone stores. if ur phone fits...go with this one. u wont be sorry.
