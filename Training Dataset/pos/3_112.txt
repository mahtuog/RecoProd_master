I'm on my second headset. The first one stopped working after only a couple months. Now this one stopped working also. The customer support was very responsive and I had a new one within a couple weeks. The first headset would not power on. Now this headset will only stay powered on while I'm in a call. I like the fit. Most other headsets I've owned did not fit well and were uncomfortable. This headset fits snugly to my head and the earbud directs the sound into your ear. I found the range is very poor. I have to keep the phone on me and on the same side of my body as the headset or I get static. I was never able to walk freely away from the phone. I have given up on this headset and I'm looking for a better one. Reading other reviews, I don't think my experience is typical for this headset.
