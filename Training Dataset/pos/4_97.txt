Let's start with the product's biggest advantage: for $37 (shipping & taxes), you've got a bona fide bluetooth headset. For those of you who wear glasses (like me) you'll appreciate how this fits into your ear and doesn't battle with your glasses for the space above your ear. It didn't seem stable at first, but when I went for a jog, it stayed in there nice and snug.On the downside, it picks up most of the ambient noise from your surroundings, so conversations outside, doing any activity, or in a mildly noisy room will be difficult, at best. If you're just looking to stay legal while driving; however, this is a good option. Just make sure to turn off your radio, first.Bottom line: if you're a serious techie, looking for a bluetooth that will allow you to place calls while under water (and yes, they do make a model that boasts that), this isn't for you. If you're looking to see what the bluetooth is all about and aren't planning on using it extensively, this is a great bargain.
