I got this phone to replace my beloved Razr. I've had this one now for @ 6 months, and I really like it. The sound quality is excellent, and it is comfortable against my ear for long periods of time, which is a plus. It is also highly customizable, another big plus for me, as well as being very easy to use- it only took @ an hour to set it up how I liked.My only complaint is the battery life, which is lacking. I have to charge it every two, or it dies. This is a little aggravating , but I've learned to just plug it into the charger every night, and no more problems.Overall, a great quality phone!
