I ordered this phone on the net for free with the 2 year Nationwide 450 rollover min Cingular plan. The phone is very well designed, pleasant to manage and small. Also, it is very, very easy to operate. The only thing that I find negative is its reception. I can hardly hear the person at the end of the line. If you use Cingular, you have 30 days to exchange it.
