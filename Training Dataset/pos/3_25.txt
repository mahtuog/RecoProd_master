the small is too small and the medium is almost too big - but those both fit in your ear and direct the sound so you can hear it good without it falling out of your ear. I used it on a samsung corded headphones that came with an instinct phone. the headphones round design is too big for normal ears and these helped. it's not a perfect fit is reason gave it 3 stars.it's priced right, but the $5 shipping is a rip-off. It could easily have shipped for under $2.
