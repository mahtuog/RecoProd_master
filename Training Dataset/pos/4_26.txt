I BOUGHT THE JAWBONE 2 SOON AS IT CAME OUT. THE JAWBONE 2 CAME OUT WITH SOME " NEW AND IMPROVED" EARBUDS, HOWEVER THEY ONLY WORKED FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. THEN THE JAWBONE 2 WOULD NOT STAY IN MY EAR. THIS WAS EXTREMELY ANNOYING SINCE THE JAWBONE 2 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE "TOP OF THE LINE".THEN I BEGAN TO SEARCH THE INTERNET AND FOUND OUT ABOUT THESE EARGELS. ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THEY FIT GREAT INSIDE MY EAR; NO SLIPPING AND SLIDING, HAVING TO CONSTANTLY ADJUST THEM. I PUT THEM IN ONCE AND GO.HOWEVER AFTER WEARING THE SAME EARGEL FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS ONCE I TAKE THE JAWBONE OUT OF MY EAR THE EARGEL WILL SLIP OFF. THIS HAS NOT BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM I JUST SLIP THE EARGEL BACK ON WHEN I GET READY TO PUT THE JAWBONE BACK IN MY EAR, AND IT STAYS PUT. THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH BUYING IF YOU HAVE THE JAWBONE 1 OR 2. THE DIFFERENCE IS NIGHT AND DAY. GREAT PRODUCT !!!!!!!
