This is a nice holder but it does break if your not careful. I just ordered my 3rd one because they seem to break easy when getting into my truck, this could be avoided if you swivel the phone before you enter a car seat. This is not a faulty design just the end user being lazy and not being careful getting in and out of a vehicle.
