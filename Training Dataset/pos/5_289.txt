The Andrew Extensis is a great product! Remove the Baby Bell service from your home or business, then plug this unit into a phone jack with the cellphone in the cradle. From any phone in your home or business, including cordless phones, you can operate exactly like you always have. The benefit?? You now have all of the features, and plan advantages of your cellular phone. It is great for a small business as the owner can take the phone when they leave, or leave it in place and allow the calls to go to voice mail.There is one potential fault. To place the Nokia phone in the cradle, one sets it into the cradle with the phone vertical. After it latches, it gently leans toward the rear of the unit. I accidently broke one I had because to remove the Nokia phone without damage, you must tilt the phone to the front of the cradle before removal.My only other concern with this device...... I wish Andrew had units available for phones other than the Nokia 5100/6100 and Startac. Once these phones are no longer available, what will we do? I can hope!
