I've been using this headset for about three months now, and although it was a little confusing at first, I've been very happy with it since I got everything working. I wanted a headset that I could use with VOIP for internet gaming, but something that I could also use for making Skype calls and listening to music wirelessly. This fits the bill pretty well. In order to use it as both a headset and headphones, I had to create two separate Bluetooth profiles on my computer. I just switch between the two for use as a headset or headphones (the sound quality is much better when used as headphones). The only drawback I have encountered is that some games with integrated VOIP do not recognize the headset as an input, but this is easily circumvented by using Teamspeak or Ventrilo, third-party VOIP software. It also comes with a Bluetooth reciever that can be plugged into any standard 1/8-inch audio jack, so you can go wireless with just about anything. Also included is a cable for use when on an airplane. Anyway... a neat little gadget.
