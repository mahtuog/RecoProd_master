I bought these to use on a Samsung WEP200 blu-tooth head set. The one I am using, works fine and fits the Samsung properly. It is much more comfortable than the thingy that came on the Samsung. I must say, it is a shame to buy something that comes in a pack of six and you can only utilize one or two out of six. It should be sold in multiple packs, all of the same size.
