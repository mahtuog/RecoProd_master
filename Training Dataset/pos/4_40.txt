I was in hell with my Jawbone until I got these. I think I need to glue the thing on with a little Superglue, which I haven't. I keep it in a little pouch in my purse with my phone so it doesn't matter if it falls off...but gluing it on would fix it. But it makes my Jawbone fit perfectly and stay in my ear, and no earloop -- I've removed the dumb earloop altogether. You have to experiment with the sizes and play around with the fit at first, then it becomes second nature.Oh, and you have to remove the Jawbone earthingy -- the rubbery piece -- which is accomplished easily enough by turning it and pulling it off. It's on a little track, and turns like a jar lid.
