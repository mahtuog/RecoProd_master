Very nice case with an excellent fit to my Palm TX. The TX is held securely in the case by means of a well-fitting plastic retainer that slides into the TX flip-cover slot. Out of the shipping container, the case clasp was a tiny bit loose but gentle pressure with the case open let me easily adjust the metal clasp to give a tighter fit. Overall, an excellent design.
