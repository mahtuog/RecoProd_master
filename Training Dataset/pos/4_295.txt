Technically its not really a charger since theres not much in the way of built in electronics and the actual power adapter isnt included. Compatable with most of the newer Motorola phones, it has a plug that snaps in when you dock the phone and has the same port comming out the back of the charger. You can plug in the A/C charger that comes with the phone or a USB data cable if you have one that goes to your computer (for address books, etc), the port on the back is a complete duplicate of the one on your phone.I've used it on the Motorola T720/730 as well as the V710 that just came out, though its not listed in the description. There is also an slot in the back to charge a separate battery at the same time. The clock on the front is battery powered like a standard wristwatch and does not use the power from the cable, not sure what the reasoning is on this, maybe they meant for it to be something that was intended to be more portable.I did have one other charger for this same phone that was a cheaper generic version. It was horrible compared to this Motorola one. The phone was hard to seat and overall it was pretty ugly. So having had the far cheaper and uglier version, I appreciated this one much more.
