The Jabra 250 bluetooth has great reception and sync's very well with my Nokia phone. It takes some time to understand the little quirks. I have called customer support 3 times with issues. The problems got fixed each time. The online FAQ page is useless and the company says (online and while you are waiting on the phone for customer support) that email is the quickest option. Jabra says they answer your email within 1-2 hours. That hasn't happened for me yet. The first email never got answered and the second got answered a day later without an response to my actual question.Even the technician on the phone said they have difficulties interpreting email questions. They have very courteous and knowledgable technical assistance reps on the phones.I like the headset. It has good reception, sync's well,comfortable, very long charge(holds longer than my phone, and has easy to press buttons. I still need to solve the constant need to resync the unit but especially for the price this is an excellent headset.
