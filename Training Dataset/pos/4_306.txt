This headset integrates seamlessly - took a whole 30 seconds to set up pairing (that's Bluetooth technobabble) and get it up and running. However, the design may look cool, but unless it's worn just "so" it's actually painful to wear. There's no padding on the over-the-ear plastic loop, or on the hard plastic earset. To really hear well, you need to press it up against the ear - and this does not feel good. It causes the ear loop to pull at the ear, and the plastic earset to smash up against your ear. If you're in a quite environment, it's great - but if your car windows are open or A/C is on high, you'll have a hard time hearing.I tried to use it in the gym - forget it. I had to cup my hand over my ear and press the headset against my ear.I like the Jabra's ergonomics better - it's really comfortable - but gave up getting it to work after 45 minutes of trying. It would pair, but would NOT communicate. I returned the Jabra and ordered the Nokia. I'll keep the Nokia - it works flawlessly.
