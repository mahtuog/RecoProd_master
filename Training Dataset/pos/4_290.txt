This tip should be labeled differently. It is actually a mini-USB tip for the Kensington charger. While it actually is for the BlackBerry it works for anything that uses a mini-USB. I wish they would have called it "mini-USB tip" to avoid the confusion I had prior to buying the thing. The price is crazy too. Kinda pricey for just one tip but if you have the charger you know that the thing is getting harder to find. I use it to charge all of my mini-USB stuff and haven't had any problems.
