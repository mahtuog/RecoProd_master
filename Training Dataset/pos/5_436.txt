Seems like a simple goal - to make a product that works well for all conceivable purposes. This one is the first thing I have owned in my entire life that gets pretty close. I expect from my head set that I can- listen to music at home (from the stereo set in the living room)- listen to music at work (Bluetooth from the laptop)- listen to music on the train, in the mall, ... (from my T-Mobile Shadow)- use it on airplanes (wired)- take phone calls while listening to music- have a clear phone conversation even when in a noisy environment- be wire-free while doing all this- do not have to recharge the device for days despite heavy use- use it in wired mode when out of battery, or to conserve battery- have acceptable sound quality and decent volume even when on batteryYou do not need another headset period. This thing does it all, and it does it well. I am very happy with it.
