I'm using the largest of the 3 sizes of EarGels that came with the shipment and it works great on my Jawbone headset. Just pop the existing earpiece off the Jawbone, fit this on, and you're done. It's comfortable, easy to insert in my ear, and fits snugly which allows me to remove the badly designed ear clip that comes with the Jawbone. The sound is also much better than before.Clever little accessory and highly recommended.
