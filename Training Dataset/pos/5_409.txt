Received the product on time.cheaper, simpler, more robust design apparently than the ZipLinq original part. Cable seems thicker and in my opinion should last longer.Connector to the Palm also fits well and tight.So far so good, I hope that it will last longer than th eZipLinq equivalent which started to malfunction after about 6 months and an estimates 50 plugging in/out.
