Not everything that I do with my mobile device is with the device in between my thumbs. A good amount of time I am in front of a computer but accessing some of the programs on my mobile for a quick reference. It is then that the JAVOedge Cradle for the Treo 680/750 comes in handy.In addition to just propping up the Treo so that I can see when a call comes in, just being able to sync my mobile easily is a lifesaver.The angle of the JAVOedge cradle is good enough to almost be a second working screen. The other thing that makes the cradle nice to work with is just sitting my mobiles off to side but within earshot of an alarm.Of course, the blue light on the cradle is a bit intense, but overall, its a simple and elegant accessory in those times when I am on the go in terms of letting me know my device is being topped of for the next mobile run.And even if you don't ever take this cradle out of your house, it is a better option than just the cables your Treo came with.
