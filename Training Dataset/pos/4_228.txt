I got the black one for Christmas for my girlfriend and now I'm getting the silver one for me. Sound quality is great and fits snugly around the ear. We actually returned a Motorola (HS850?) and got this one because the Motorola hook that went around the ear was a little flimsy so it flopped around a bit too much. This one feels sturdy and the ear piece fits comfortably, partially in the ear. The only reason it doesn't get a 5th star is it's not quite as intuitive as the Motorola's design that has the boom that flips open and close to turn it on/off.
