This item leaves me wondering... HOW did i exist before i had it!No more getting up from the computer to nearly kill myself because i'm still attached. I can wander around my house doing assorted things while maintaining a conversation with my friends. I can listen to my work related phone messages in privacy, and without interruption.I like the flexibility these headphones give me and while I was skeptical of the voice tube, I gave it a shot because I have been a user for years of Plantronics call center headsets and they are top notch.I have since bought one for a friend and recommended it to many others and we all love them.My only disappointment is that the the post on one side is starting to crack a little bit, but that is with exceptionally heavy use -- probably 18 hours a day, 7 days a week.Wouldn't hesitate to buy another.
