I owned one of these previously, and was very happy with it. It lasted about eighteen months before the leather around the clip finally began to tear, making the clip's hold on the case tenuous at best. So I gladly bought a replacement.At first glance, the new pouch looks the same. The problem with the clip tearing away from the pouch has been addressed - that part of the case has been reworked and reinforced with a thicker piece of leather - you can now slide the case onto your belt instead of clipping it to your belt.The case seems a little larger that the original - My Treo seems to slide a little from front to back. The interior of the case still has a snapped cover concealing storage compartments for three memory cards. In effect, the case is functionally the same as the original one I had.But you know, I finally figured out why I don't like it. It seems cheaper that the original one. The interior is made out of some kind of fabric and there's a puffy feel to the leather exterior, almost as if the leather is sown on top of a cushion. The original one seems more expensive, more luxurious, by comparison.In short, the case is functional, but its not as good as the original version of this product was. However, ots still better than anything else I've found on the market to date.
