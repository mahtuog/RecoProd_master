Several years ago I tried an early bluetooth headset that was useless, due to a short battery life. I recently decided to see if the technology had improved, and based on the Amazon reviews, chose the Jabra. The Jabra is a joy to use. I put it in my ear, and often forget it is there. It is great while driving. The sound is loud and clear. In fact, my BlackBerry is sometimes difficult to hear. Tha Jabra solves that problem, with great volume. I have used the thing for hours without ever getting a low battery indication. This is not a gimic. It is a useful and effective tool.
