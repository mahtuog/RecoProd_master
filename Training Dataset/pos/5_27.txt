These EarGels are the best solution bar-none to fix the comfort issue with the Aliph Jawbone 2. They make it possible to leave the jawbone in place for extreme durations. My only concern now is that my jawbone is so comfy and fixed it so well with no weight that I might fall asleep on it or take a sower with it on! To mod this onto the jawbone I simply removed the earbud O-ring and found the right size eargel for my ear. (Large in this case) then got some super glue to paint around where the O-ring attached on the jawbone, then simply placed the jawbone inside the eargel that I fitted on my ear. Left it in my ear for a few hours to dry and done. (Course I kept wearing it even after those hours were up) :)
