This is definitely a good cell phone.I have seen all those fancy cell phone with huge screen and photo capabilities, but what's the point? I only want to call people with my phone, and if it does that, I am happy, and this phone does it well and has a good price.I have also dropped this phone about 50 times since I got it 6 monthes ago and not a single thing has gone wrong for the phone as a result of my carelessness.I think this is a perfect phone for someone who wants to keep things simple
