I've had this phone for over a year and I love it! It's not without its faults, but overall you can't beat it. Here are some of the things I'm not crazy about:> No 2.5mm headphone jack, just the USB> Sometimes a little slow/glitchy, but not bad.> Only one, not very smart, alarm clock. This one is probably a small issue for most people, but I use my phone as an alarm clock a lot and it basically treats it like an appointment, so snooze options are really funky and I can't choose the tone. There's probably a program or something I could install, but it would have been nice to not have to mess with.> The keyboard buttons are small, but I can navigate and type still with only a few errors. (I'm a guy with slender fingers, so someone with thicker fingers would probably have more of an issue.)Otherwise, this is a great phone, but only for the casual user. I don't think business users would have tolerance for some of the features it lacks and for the money, you could get something more suited to your needs. But someone wanting a phone that's nicer than just a run-of-mill freebie from your provider, but not a full on, business intensive PDA/phone, then this is for you.Call quality in any mode (handset, speaker, headset) is perfect, features are really good (Word, Excel, Adobe reader, etc.), Windows Media Player, etc.Basically, I'm only shopping again because the kids got mine wet and it shorted out. It still works, but the battery life, which was amazing before (2-3 days of moderate use without charging), isn't what it used to be. I'll be trying to either fix my phone or replace it, but not changing models unless I really have too.
