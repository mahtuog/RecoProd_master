I am very happy with this product. They are very comfortable and come with 3 diffrent sizes that should work for most people. My only gripe is that they don't fit every single diffrent headset out there. They worked great for mine but I need a new one and I noticed that only about half of the bluetooth headsets out there will fit these.
