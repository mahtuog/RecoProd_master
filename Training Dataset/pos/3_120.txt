I bought this plan first bill came with an extra 30$ as all kinds of extra charges so you will end up paying 100 $ per month to verizon , rather than 69.99 shown on the amazon page. LG phone is good but speaker phone sucks. I read some reviews abt the battery life, i let the battery drain completely and recharge it compltely a couple of times, it gives me 3 days with bluetooth on. i ont talk much, but it shd give you 2days even if you talk a lot.
