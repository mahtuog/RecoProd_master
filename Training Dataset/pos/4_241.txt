I recently bought this phone for 20$ as a GoPhone after losing my Samsung Sync :( I was fully prepared for a phone that was way below the Sync but this phone is on par and better in some areas.Pros:The speaker is amazingly loud-especially compared to the Sync. Voice quality is normal. The cool thing is that you can play music while doing anything else you want!The screen is the same vibrant big screen as the Sync and many newer phones. You can even change the main screen so that it has shortcuts and a calender like a smartphone!Cons:The flip button works great unles you accedentaly block the flip with your finger.The sd card is behind the battery cover. This is not a problem unless you take the card out a lot.Battery life is extremely short but if you charge it every night it should be good.Overall i liked this phone as much as the sync and better in some respects
