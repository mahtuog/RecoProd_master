I bought these for my Jawbone and it makes my Jawbone so much better and functional. It gives you a choice of three sizes (one of each size per ear). I thought they worked great and really helped keep the sound in my ear. The did move on the Jawbone a bit but I could fix that with a little glue if I wanted.
