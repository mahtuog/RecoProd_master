While the concept for this product is perfect, in reality audio quality is poor due to the fact that this headset requires the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), which is not widely supported at this time.I thought I would be able to use this to listen to music stored in my PowerBook G4 laptop, which I would think is a fairly common use case. To my surprise, the audio quality was no better than AM radio. It was really dissapointing. I contacted Plantronics Technical Support only to learn that I would have to use the universal adapter, which defeats the purpose of having a Bluetooth headset. Plantronics needs to disclose this issue, since so few devices currently support A2DP.
