For years, I have resisted the whole cellphone, constantly connected to the world thing. Then, this Christmas, my folks decided to put me on their Cingular family plan and finally force a cellphone on me. At the cellphone store, all I cared about was finding something small, simple, and unobtrusive. This phone seemed like it would fill those requirements perfectly. Well, it has. Both call quality and battery life have seemed more than adequate. I live on the edge of civilization in northwest Colorado where cell towers are few and far between, but I have had what is (to me) suprising success in getting a good signal where one would expect one to be. It's small size is a real boon to me, or anyone like me who does field work outdoors and has to carry around all manner of other gadgets and equipment and doesn't need a large device getting in the way or getting banged up. If you need a good reliable form of communication and also don't need it to be the center of your life, this model fits the bill.
