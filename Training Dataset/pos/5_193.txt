This is the second Armour Case I have bought for a Palm PDA; prior to this I had used the Palm brand had cases. Unfortunately, this will probably be the last Armour Case I purchase, not because of the case but because the Palm PDA's are no longer being made. Having said that, I would get it again in a minute if I had a need: it is easy to open but does not open by itself the way the Palm-made hard cases I have used do. It has the right cut-outs in the right places meaning I can plug it into the computer or the power cord while still in the case (unlike the Palm-made hard case, where you have to almost remove the unit to access these slots). Having TWO Palm PDA's stolen in the last year (Note to thieves: these are NOT phones, guys!), I was lucky to still be able to get a Palm replacement as well as another one of these cases. But, I doubt I'll be able to get another Palm PDA if it happens again, which is unfortunate.
