I was talked into this phone when I almost used my old Motorola as a hockey puck when it "spontaneously died" along with 2 other Cingular customers who also had the Motorola V557- Our phones just powered off and would not power on, and we were all within a month of contract end and planning to go to Nextel. However, the phone has performed well. Battery life could be more like I was led to expect, but it is ok. It charges best if turned off, and the camera (not a critical accessory) is phenomenal, sometimes outperforming my wife's digital. However my carrier is still big disappointment.
