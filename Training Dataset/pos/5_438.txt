The foam ear pads get a little soggy if you're sweating on the treadmill, but otherwise it works great with my cell phone and any audio device. The much-mentioned 1/2 second lag for video does exist, but in my opinion it's a small price for the freedom of wireless. If you're expecting a perfect video-watching experience, you should be viewing on a bigger screen.
