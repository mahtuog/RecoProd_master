I think this is a great phone. I bought it to have a GSM phone in Peru and it worked great. Good signal strength. Good sound quality. The battery seems to last forever. For voice, I couldn't be happier with this little phone.However ... I echo the other reviewer's complaint that text messaging does not work. I spent hours in Peru trying to make it work. I returned to the USA and found the English language manual online and looked up text messaging. The manual says it exists, but the relevant menu option never appears on the phone. This wouldn't be so much of a problem for me except, in Peru at least, it is necessary to use text messaging to find out how much money is left on the prepaid SIM card. We had to keep moving the SIM card into our ultra-cheap Peruvian phone to send a text message, which was a pain.
