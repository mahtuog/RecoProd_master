I bought this for my blackberry pearl. It snaps right onto the phone wihtout any problems at all...it did get a little tricky when it came to puttint the clip on the back of the phone, You have to use this tacky strip and a screw to put it in this square hole...very odd but we figured it out. the clip allows you to flip the phone to a 360 degree angle, and is easy to remove from wherever you have it clipped from. It was a very good price, it is still in once piece so I would say all in all it is a good deal.
