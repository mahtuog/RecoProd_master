I love this bluetooth. It has very clear reception, good fitting over the ear, very comfortable. I even forget I have it on my ear. The instructions are easy to read and understand. I would recommend this to anyone and I would buy another in a heart beat. I love the color also. It is a soft pink color and it looks great. Easy to use and the battery lasts a long time before it needs recharging.
