I bought and installed the Nokia car kit (CARK-91) for my Nokia phone. Now, it is a real pleasure and quite safe to talk and drive. I often hold conference calls in my car on the way into the office. When travelling with the family, we often call the grandparents because it is the one place where everyone can join in the call at once. And the car kit is almost invisible with all but the cradle hidden behind the dashboard panels. The cradle is strong and sturdy, and, with the phone attached, does not look out of place next to the steering wheel. Combined with Nokia's quick dial features, the car kit makes using a phone in the car relatively safe.
