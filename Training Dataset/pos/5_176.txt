For those who wear glasses, this is the best!(Try to avoid ANY headset with hooks if you wear glasses no matter what other people say, IT WILL NO FIT and HURT your ears)For those who don't wear glasses, it is 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that the sound quality is not as good as Samsung's WEP200. (not sure about other "hookless" headset)Battery Life, full charge, at least 4+ hours continuous talk time (I tested it personally)It weights like nothing to your ear.I had hard time to fit WEP200 on my ear, but AX2 is a snuggle fit. For half the price of WEP200, I will buy AX2.If you outside of the network and have no reception, the headset will do a "beep beep" signal for you, it will keep doing it until your phone get back the reception. Some people found it annoying, some people think this is a useful feature.Pro: Cheap, Tight Fit, VERY Light weight, BEST for people who wear glasses.Con: Okay sound quality, very loud wind noise @ outdoor (on the listener side).One more notice, for people who are going to get it, PLEASE read the instruction included carefully before you try to wear it. That plastic sticking out DOES NOT GOES INTO YOUR EAR CANAL. It sits within the grove inside of the external ear to secure the ear piece. So don't poke yourself to deaf with that.
