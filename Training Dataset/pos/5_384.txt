I'm one who has always had terrible luck with cellphone headsets. I've owned corded headsets from all major companies, motorola, jabra, plantronics, sony, and I was dissappointed by all of them. I bought this one with very little hope that it would be any better than the others. Boy was I surprised when I fired this baby up and experienced the sound quality this thing offered. I'm also quite pleased with how this thing fits on my ear. I was able to try on the Motorola HS810 at a local BestBuy and I didn't like the way it fit. The Jabra feels much more secure. I also like the large eargel that goes into your ear canal. Excllent!I bought this in December 2004 and it is now March 2005 and I want to say that I still love it! It still works perfectly.
