I've had my AX2 now for about two weeks. So far, I really like it for it's size and weight. It's small enough so that I don't look like the Borg (Star Trek) when wearing it, and I don't feel any weight on my ear. I got used to the "antenna" used to hold it in place almost immediately. But unfortunately, the sound quality could be better. The speaker inside the earpiece delivers a lot of treble with little bass. Inside this seems to be okay, but outside I've had to ask my girlfriend to repeat statements a lot. If you plan to use the AX2 indoors, I'd definitely recommend it. But if you're looking for a bluetooth headset for outdoors, I might consider looking at other brands with better overall sound quality.
