The Palm fits into the cover securely and perfectly. The cover snaps closed a bit stiffly at first but after a week clicks shut easily and securely. Light slim solid case that takes a dropping well. Front cover has clearance so Palm's screen is not impacted at all. Two slots in front cover hold standard SD cards. Looks like there is enough clearance so cards will not press onto Palm's screen but I haven't tested that. Recessed access to top and bottom connection points on the Palm provide protection without ever having to take the Palm out of the case. It's very functional.
