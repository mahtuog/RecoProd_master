I bought this headset after having a Nokia HDW-2 headset for about a year, before its battery went south.Did my research, thought this one was the best of the lot.Found out I was nearly right. This is *much* better than the HDW-2. Very little static, doesn't drop calls. Haven't found the limits of the battery (yet), and I've used it in standby mode for nearly 8 hours straight. Works well with the Nokia 3650, including the voice dialing.My talk times are not that long, so I haven't stressed the talk limits yet.As to cons, the only con I've found so far is with fit. The smaller earpiece of those supplied still irritates my ear after a few hours of wearing (on the right ear). Wearing it on the left ear doesn't seem to get as raw, but the piece doesn't fit as well (yes, I've turned the ear-bead the correct way!). However, I take the piece off for a few minutes rest and I'm back in business. Or I move it to the left side for a while.Only other drawback is that I have to turn the Bt250 off before I can use my Bluetooth on my Palm Pilot with the phone. I guess its only one bluetooth device at a time.Charging is easy. Pairing with my Nokia 3650 was a snap.Is it a toy? Yes, like all technology that doesn't keep you alive, its a toy.If you want a wireless headset, I think this is the one for the moment.
