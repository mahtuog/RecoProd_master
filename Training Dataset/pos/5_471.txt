I ordered this case two days after I ordered a skin from another company. A few days later expecting the skin; this case was in my mailbox. So far, I totally pleased with it. It fits perfectly. The magnet for shuting off the Pearl's screen works perfect. I guess I question is it truly produce by Blackberry (OEM) because I notice on the photos (also from RIM's website), the stitching is white and on the product I received, it's black. I just wonder if it is an OEM product; how can they sale it so cheaply? It's a $25 buck case retail. Can I live with the black stitching? Heck yes! This case appears to be well constructed, the price is awesome and VibeCelluar had it to me in days after the order. It's now 3/27 and the skin is no where to be found. Very, very happy. Is it a knock off? I hope not but I think no one would know. I'll buy another in a heartbeat!!!
