The bluetooth connection to the Motorola phone doesn't connect easily. It worked well once connected.The headset needs some additional padding for comfort.I used it with my iPod and it worked well if the comfort was better.But the main purpose I purchased this for was to connect to my computer and Skype phone. I haven't figured out how to get the mike to work for this purpose.
