This simple matt black case is tough and the TX fits in it snugly. Its well designed to access ports without removing it from the case. I had a leather case for my last palm. It looked a bit more stylish but because it was soft it was always pressing on the command buttons and turning itself on. No such problem with this shell case. The only design improvement I would suggest would be a slightly rubberized exterior like I have on my motorola cell phone. It really helps me to keep from dropping it. The metal case is a bit slippery. I'm happy with it.
