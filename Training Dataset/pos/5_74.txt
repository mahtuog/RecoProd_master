I recently purchased a Aliph Jawbone BT headset. #1 BT Headset on the market IMHO. I wasn't wild about the piece that goes around your ear however. I never have been. So I picked up a pack of the Jabra EarGels. Best decision of my life. I pulled the plastic ring that snaps onto the Jawbone out of one of the earpieces that comes with it and stuck it inside the EarGel. Snapped it onto the Jawbone, and bingo. Instant comfort. Can't go wrong. Great product!
