I have read a lot of reviews for this and the Motorolla headset. While I have never used the Motorolla one I like this one better because no one notices it in my ear. The reception is great, the sound is clear, and no one has complained they couldn't hear me. I have had it for a month with no problems. The only issue I have is when I am near corless phones or wireless networks I have to hold the phone closer to the headset. However when I am at the mall or in the park I do not need to take my phone out of it's case. All in all this is a great headset.
