Ummmm....for all those who gave it less than a 5....are you kidding me? Other bt headsets don't even compare to this one. This one stays put on your ear, it has great volume and it is so easy to hook up. PLUS...it has features that most other headsets don't. Believe me, I am the queen of returns because I am always trying to find a good headset and am always disappointed. I was very pleased with this one! I think Motorola is CRAP!!!! It does not stay put and there is so much static but this one is great! And for those who complain about the wind....you may want to put the headset on the other ear...away from the window! It's only a headset...it is not NASA engineered to wear while swimming, jogging, taking a shower or biking!
