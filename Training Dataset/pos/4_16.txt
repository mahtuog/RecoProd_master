They work fine, keep the Jawbone firmly in the right place, and are almost comfortable. There are 6 in the package: 3 sizes each for left and right ear. I was surprised that the one that worked for me is the large one (no, i don't have gigantic ears!) :0) so try them all on until you find one that works.With the Jawbone, put the small plain rubber ring on first, then the eargel goes over the ring.
