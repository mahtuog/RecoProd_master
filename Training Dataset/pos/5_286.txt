This is a great Phone! ITs my 3rd phone and i have had problems with 2 of the three. the first one was ugly, and the second one, the battery life was no good. But when i got this LG C1300, it rocked my world! The Battery Life is awesome and the features are real good. You can download ringtones without going online which is really cool and easy. It has a well lit screen and the volume of the ringtones are really loud. The hearing part is awesome, i put it on a volume 3, because when it was on a 5 its like a speaker phone. It only includes one game which is very similar to snake. The picture does not look the same, the big thing in the middle is really a mirror like thing and it flashes green, it does not stay solid. Overall it is a really good phone and i reccommend everyone to go and buy it!
