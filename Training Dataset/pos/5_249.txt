These Batteries are worth the money. They are cheap and you will not go wrong.I did have a problem with 2 of the 4 I bought, but it is minor. The Batter Indicator will not show up and is showing "Invalid Battery". It works fine, sometime the indicator will work and sometime it will not. I can get a good 4 days out of it with no problems.
