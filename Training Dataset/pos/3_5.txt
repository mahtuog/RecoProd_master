I bought these eargels thinking that with 3 different sizes, one would fit a normal size ear. It turns out that all 3 sizes in the package are too large and the headset does not stay in place but keeps falling out. I have had friends and family try them with the same results. the description should read medium, large and extra large. I f you have a normal to smaller ear don't bother with these.
