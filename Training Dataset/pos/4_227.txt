This plantronics is a great headset that is easy to use and provides a pretty good experience overall.*** THE POSITIVE POINTS INCLUDE: ***- Lightweight and fits snugly on the ear. You really do not feel the headset much at all.- Is on the small side so it doesn't make you feel like a telemarketing agent- Controls are excellent and easy to use (basically it is a multifunction joystick that you press to voice-dial/hangup/ or answer, and slide forward or backward for volume up or down.- Provides a flashing light indicator of the remaining charge left when you power on the headset. The light flahses 3 times to indicate full charge, 2 times to indicate 2/3 charge and one time to let you know the battery is nearly depleted. This feature is very rare in this price range and is a big plus point because there is nothing worse than having your headset battery die mid-conversation because you did not know how much charge you had left.- The battery life is excellent compared to other bluetooth headset I have used.- Is very easy to switch from Right to Left ear (Unlike Motorola headsets that require you to snap off the earpiece and re-attach it!)*** THE NEGATIVE POINTS INCLUDE: ***- Not Bluetooth 2.0 compliant so it does not have the extended range or speed.- There is no way to disable the multicolor LED from flashing an alternating blue and red during calls, so the whole world notices you are making a call.- There are no distinctive musical tones to indicate power on or power up (like how the Motorola headsets play crescendo or decrescendo to indicate power up or down)- Does not have the range of some of the other bluetooth 1.2 headset I have used (although it is a difference of just a few feet)- There is a slight degree of static (especially on power up or when you voicedial) but it is not unacceptable nor is it that noticeable during conversations.- My Volume setting seem to be lost whenever I power down the headset.- The charger uses an unusual tip (not a common Mini-USB like other headsets) which means you cannot charge this in the car or from your laptop)Overall you cannot go wrong with this headset. I have owned a variety of headsets including Motorola, Nokia, and even another Plantronics that fits around the ear and I must say that this one is by far the easiest and most comfortable to use.
