I'm not someone who buys a phone on a whim. I'm too poor for that sort of extravagance. So when my last phone went kaput it became inevitable to buy a new one. I wanted something sturdy and no nonsense, but didn't look like it weighed a ton . I wanted something that didn't make me feel like I needed a degree in phone science to operate it, but also oozed technological savvy.In short, what I was looking for was something like the Sony Ericsson K800i. I fell in love with a lot of the features:1. The fun, quick camera that you could operate quickly and without a fuss2. The user friendly interface3. The fact that it could probably double as a music player if you wanted it to.4. The large screen5. The elegant design of the phone (in a stylish black, with clean design lines)and so forth.The only real sore point with me is that the phone doesn't interface with my PC as well as I had hoped it would. I don't know if it's a driver problem or whatever, but Sony really should have hammered out the connection routines a bit more before releasing this gem. A small flaw in an otherwise perfect package. I love this phone and can't think of a more fun one on the market. Buy it if you want something that is simple to use, but has bells and whistles to boot.
