i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync (an idiot design if you ask me), and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires. and to buy a cradle which used to come with the palms was an extra $30-40! so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat, and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing. the reason why it got only 4 stars is b/c when i first tried it, my computer said that it didn't recognize the usb device. i searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why. it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more. so the connector part could be a little sturdier, that's all.
