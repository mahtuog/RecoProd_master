THE S710 IS A FAIRLY GOOD PHONE.MY MAIN PROBLEM WITH THE PHONE IS THAT THE PROCESSOR IS SO DAM SLOW.WHEN U OPEN THE PHONE IT TAKES 3 SECONDS FOR THE SCREEN TO GO FROM VERTICAL TO HORIZONTAL. THE PHONE HAS SOME MINOR GLITCHES EVERY NOW(I DONT KNOW A SMART PHONE THAT DOSENT) AND THEN BUT NOTHING BIG.I DONT LIKE THE WAY THE PAGES ARE DISPLAYED WHEN USING WIFI BUT IT DOES WORK.THE BATTERY LAST LONG AND CHARGES QUICKLY.THE SIGNAL IS ALLWAYS GREAT THE HOME SCREEN IS ADJUSTABLE BUT TO A POINT.I DONT KNOW IF HTC HAS DOWNLOADABLE THEMES AT THEIR WEBSITE.THE WORD PROGRAMS WORK WELL BUT THERE WAS ONE INSTANCE WHERE I TRANSFERED A DOCUMENT (PAY SPREAD SHEET) FROM A JAZJAM TO MY PHONE.IT WORKED BUT PART OF IT WAS MISING. AS FOR THE PLAYERS I DONT KNOW IF IT PLAYES MP4'S BUT EVERY FILE I PUT ON THERE PLAYS FINE THE EAR BUDS SUCK BUT YOU CAN BUY AN ADAPTER THAT HAS AN STANDARD PORT.THE MEDIA PLAYER WORKS GREAT AND IN FULL SCREEN.THE COOLEST FEATURE IT HAS IS THE ABLITY TO MAKE YOUR OWN RING TONES.YOU CAN TAKE A MUSIC FILE AND TRIM IT FOR WICH PORTION OF THE SONG YOU WANT.THE CAMERA HAS A LOT OF FEATURES BUT IT'S STILL A 2 MP CAMERA.THE SOUND IS GREAT THE EAR SPEAKER AND REAR SPEAKER ARE LOUD AND CLEAR.I DONT HAVE A BLUE TOOTH SO I CANT COMMENT ON THAT.ITS ALSO GREAT THAT YOU CAN BE ON A CALL AND NAVIGATE THE OTHER FEATURES OF THE PHONE LIKE CHECK YOUR TEXT MESSAGES WRITE A DOCUMENT ECT. IF YOU DONT LIKE STABING YOUR PHONE WITH A STICK LIKE I DO THIS IS A GOOD BUY
