This is an amazing piece of equipment. I have used the RAZR V3 for 2 years. This is only that much better. Bright screen. Brillient Graphics. Fast operating system. Huge memory. Decent camera. Quantum improvement over the original RAZR v3The downside: Cingular has replaced the functional "Mail" button with their "Video" button. I own a phone to talk and text. Cingular wants you to watch "Video" ($10.00/minute without plan). Push that button by mistake and it will be a very expensive day.A fantastic phone by Motorola undone by Cingular's "Marketing" department.Can't wait to purchase an unlocked, unhijacked version of this incredible phone.
