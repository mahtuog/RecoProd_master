I'm not going to bore you with the many features that this particular phone has since its user's guide is online at Nokia. My complaint is about how small the numbers (4,6,7,9) are. To dial a number one has to actually use both hands since using one hand can lead to mistakenly dial the intended number. I don't have large hands at all and have found this problem to be very cumbersome to overcome with one hand. One user also complained about the screen going blank when recharging. I agree with him. This happens only if the phone is off but the user is left wondering whether the phone is charging or completely charged. I don't know of any phone that blanks out when charging.-AC
