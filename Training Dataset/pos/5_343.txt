I actually liked the look of this so much that I bought it for my iPhone!!! It probably fits most any phone, but I liked the idea that it would stand out on my cluttered desk. It's perfect. I can use my phone with out even taking it (very easy) out of the stand. It may have "Blackberry" printed on it, but you have to look real close to see it. For the price, it's just what this Dr. ordered.
