I am a guy with big fingers and I had no problem with the cutout for the trackwheel but I did have to adjust the case (move a little to the right)to get a good fit. My only complaint is it needs the swivel adapter otherwise when the phone rings you must unclip from your belt unlike the pushbutton releases I am used to!
