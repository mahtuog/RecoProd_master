I listen to my iPod all day at my desk at work, and was finally getting tired of being tied to the headphone cord. So I went shopping for wireless headphones and after a bit of research I ended up with these.I've had these for several months and they are working great. I turned the sound on the iPod as high as it would go and turn down the sound on the headphones, and that gets rid of the static sound that some people have reported. I leave the headset in the charging cradle overnight and haven't had any problems with the battery running down during the work day. If I forget to charge it then it dies a few hours into the second day. The sound quality is fine, although I admit I'm not an audiophile, and it blocks out enough ambient noise for me to be able to concentrate on my work but isn't totally sound-blocking so I can still hear when somebody says my name.The only reason I took off a star is they fit rather tightly on my head (and I'm a woman with a relatively small head) so my ears are starting to get a little sore by the end of the day. And some earrings make it impossible to wear these, although the vast majority are fine.
