Now that NJ has gotten ticket happy for people who talk on their cell phones while driving, this bluetooth is a great choice. It's rechargeable, lightweight and easy to use. I don't use it that often (about once a week) so I have no idea how long the battery lasts if used on a daily basis, but since I've had it, I've only had to charge it once. Great chioce if you want an inexpensive, rechargeable bluetooth.
