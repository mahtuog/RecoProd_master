My daughter is using it for her iPad. She likes it but says that the rubber bands on it come off easily. It is definitely meant for people with small fingers. She likes how the mini stylus clicks to the iPad so she does not lose it. Overall she is definitely recommending the product to other people. It's just another cool toy for your iPad.
