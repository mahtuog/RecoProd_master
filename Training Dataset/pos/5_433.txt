I searched high and low for a overhead headset for my new Sprint Instinct. Nothing was in the market except ear buds which I'm not comfortable wearing. I found this product and it's perfect. I can hear clearly, it's mobile, carries a long charge and folds up small (with case) for traveling. Actually the sounds so good that on my last overseas flight I left the BOSE home and used the included airplane mode and connector to listen to films, music and work on my computer. Granted, they aren't noise canceling like the BOSE, but it was great to just carry one small headset instead on two. I've had these about a month and haven't found any issues. Yes, the volume is clumsy and a little hard to use on the side of the air pieces, but I rarely need to make adjustments since the sound is clear.
