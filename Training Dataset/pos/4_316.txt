I am happy with this. It is definately not the color it looks like in the picture. It is more of a nubuck, brown leather. A more standard leather color. I don't know what that one guy is complaining about with the magnets (the review may have been for the black one, I bought both). They are quite strong. No manner of violent shaking will release the phone (I tried very hard!). I would feel comfortable taking it on my motorcycle. It is also BIGGER than it looks in the picture. This added biggness isn't just waste though. It is thicker in everywhere the phone is likely to get whomped. Seeing it in person, I would have payed 15-20 bucks for it. It beats any of the stuff motorola makes for the razr. Stylish too.
