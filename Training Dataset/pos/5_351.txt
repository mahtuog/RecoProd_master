Went to replace phone battery at local AT&T store. Was told that they didn't make the battery anymore, and even if I could find it it would cost $40 to $50 dollars. Ended up with a new phone, and wondering "What just happened?" Found battery on web, took new phone back. Got the battery and delivery for a little over $5.
