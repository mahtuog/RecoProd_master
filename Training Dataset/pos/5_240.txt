I was a little skeptical about buying a battery at such a low price. A bit worried it would be of low quality. I was wrong. This extended battery has preformed fanstastic and holds its' charge better then so called OEM batteries found on other "auction" sites. Great product at a fantastic price! Would not hesitate to buy again
