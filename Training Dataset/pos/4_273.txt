I have only had this item for a short time, and I have not used it more than a handful of times. The sound quality is pretty good, but I'm not an audiophile. Works great with my Sony Ericsson phone as well as my Ipod. If a call comes in while I'm listening to my music, an audible alert is sounded, and a push of the side button will switch the headset to my phone. Then when the call is ended, the music switches back automatically. Nice for travel and on the plane. Only complaint so far is that the set seems like it could be built a little more durably. The flashing blue light on the right ear can be annoying if I am on the plane...I'm sure it irritates my neighbors, especially if the cabin lights are dimmed. There should be an option to turn this off on bluetooth devices in my opinion. The flashing light is a waste of battery power. Excellent battery life with this product as well.
