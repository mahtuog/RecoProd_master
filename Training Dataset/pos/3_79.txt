This product is certainly durable and it has protected my phone which is what I bought it for. Unfortunately though removing it isn't easy and getting it off hurts a bit. It needs to be removed regularly to get the dust out that collects around the inside of the case from being in your bag or pocket. It would be GREAT if it still fit in a case after putting it on so that you could have the option if you wanted it to.But I'll take durability over a clean phone usually... if I HAVE to.
