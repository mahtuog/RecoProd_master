Bought these for my Aleph Jawbone IPROS: Fit right on, stays snug. Do not have to use the ear loop any more. Cheap. Isolates sound from background noise better than stock Jawbone earpieces.CONS: Ocassionally comes the headset when not in use or when I take it off my ear. Could not find one that fit my ear perfectly.BOTTOM LINE: A no-brainer upgrade for Jawbone users. Not a perfect solution but much better than what came with the Jawbone and its too cheap to not give it a try.
