I've had this case for close to a year now and had no problems with it up until 2 months ago when I noticed one of the plastic hinges that attaches the Palm to the case snapped off, the remaining intact hinge has held up for about 2 months so far. The clasp has been fine and holds the case firmly shut, great access to all buttons and slots. I would have given it 5 stars but the hinge broke.
