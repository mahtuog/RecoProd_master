When I first received this I thought that it was cheap feeling and I really didn't like it. I had a blue tooth heavy duty motorolla before, which felt more high quality. I now have grown to like this item. I don't like how you have to turn it on and off all the time. I wish there was an easier way. You have to hold down the button for 3 seconds. Sometimes there is static on the other end. The battery life is okay. Nothing spectacular. Overall I'd give this an average score.
