This is a great cell phone holster. I use it with generic flip phones. This holster supports cell phones that are approximately 2 inches wide and up to 4 inches tall. The holster has panels that stretch making it easy to adapt to most phones.FYI, I ordered this unit from WebTreo. They sent me a wider version which was 2.5 inches wide. It was a lot of hassle getting hold of the seller to get the exchange made. Two weeks later I received the correct unit.
