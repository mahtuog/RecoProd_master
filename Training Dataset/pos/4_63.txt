I haven't tried this yet. But it looks good .. came in a cheap packing, maybe because its a OEM and also the fact that how much can you expect for $2. The shipping and handling were more costly than the actual item. Anyway as one of the review said, it is not different from what is shown on the website and I assume it will also work without any problem ..
