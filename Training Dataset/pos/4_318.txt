I've been using this case for about two months now. The materials could be a bit better but I've had no significant problems. I very much like the slim profile and for the price, I'd rather have a couple of these than a more expensive type of case. A problem I had with other cases was how far off the belt they hung which this solves nicely by really hugging your belt. The tan is definitely darker than shown. Decent case for the money in my opinion. Pro is it's slim profile and firm belt clip. Con is that the materials could be better.
