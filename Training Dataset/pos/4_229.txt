This was my first bluetooth headset, so I unfortunately don't have another product to compare it to. However, I feel that it works pretty well for me. I can hear the other person very clearly and vice versa. It also holds a charge for a long time, and it's inconvenient because it fits in my bag perfectly. Would recommend to anyone.
