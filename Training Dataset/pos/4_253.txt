Pros: I use it for ipod mini and Motorola A630 and it works like charm going back and forth. It looks even slicker in person and the hard carrying case is very useful. The headest is comfortable and mobile (It's small and light once you fold it). Battery lasts two full days of use. I can stroll down five offices and kitchen^^ without being cut off. Phone quality is amazing and music quality is acceptible. It's a lot better the wireless headset I have.Cons: Wire sticks out when folding ear piece (u have to fold to store). half second lag but it bothers you only if you are calling the person right next to you.Overall, It works great for me and looks great.
