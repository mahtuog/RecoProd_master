If you are one that doesn't sweat for a living or around anything loud, its not bad. Volume could be a bit better but when you begin to have a hard time hearing somebody they are already complaining about the background noise. I have a beard as some I sweat which is death for the mic. I lost two that way. The closest thing I came to for a fix was make a "dog cone" out of electrical tape. When using with the BlackBerry 7520 it disconnects several times a day without indication. In short, if you are a pencil pusher and drive you car with the windows up all the time you will love this headset the fit and feel are wonderful. If you sweat, work around semi noisey stuff, and drive with your windows open save your money. I have also tried the Scala 500 and a few of the Motorola. They all kill the ear and Scala just wasn't loud enough. I am off to try the Plantronics Voyager..
