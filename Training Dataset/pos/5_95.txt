This device works great! The speaker is hidden under the dash and it still sounds perfect. The microphone does not have any feedback and picks up anyone's voice anywhere in the car. The external antanne (supported but not included) is great as the typical cell phone reception in my area is weak. I also like the small personal handset for private conversations. I did my own installation but would recommend hiring it done unless you have done something like this before (tapping into the fuse box, mounting hardware in a car, pulling wires under the dash). A reasonable installation charge would be between $50 and $100(it's not easy). I had to purchase an additional "post" to mount the cradle to as I could not find a suitable place to use the mount provided with the kit. This is a great unit and looks very professional when installed. Only problem is after using mine, everyone else in my family wants one!
