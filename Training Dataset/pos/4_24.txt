I use these on the Aliph Jawbone so it's not surprise they're not perfect matches to each other. The eargels fit over the speaker nub on the Jawbone it's not exactly secure and I find the eargels fall off occasionally. I was also expecting these to act more like earplugs, that snugly fit in your ear canal but that isn't the case. However, the eagels do fit quite comfortably. I would imagine they're pretty good on the headset for which they were designed. They're nice and soft and molded to fit most ears, I would think (they fit mine pretty well). They're just little pieces of plastic so I'm not sure what else to say about them. If you're current headset is uncomfortable, I'd say go ahead and buy a set of these. They're not very expensive and you might find a good solution!
