Let's face it, unless you want to go iPhone, there's not much exciting about the current cell phone market. I've had my Moto v710 since September 2004. The only problem I was having was battery life. I bought 2 of these replacement batteries because of the price. I figured just in case one is a dud I'll have a second and still it wouldn't be a bad deal. The battery is awesome - longer life than the original battery when it was new. I got it back in May and it's still working great - haven't noticed much decline in its lifespan either. And if it does ever start to lose charge, I still have an unopened one. Do yourself a favor and get 2... you'll be set until a worthwhile phone comes along that is worth the upgrade.
