I don't know what is wrong with your headset or phone, but I have the Motorola V551 and it works great with the BT250! I just turned in on, had my phone pair with it and it worked all in less that a minute. Don't believe the other guy, this is the bluetooth headset to get! Great sound and very comfortable.
