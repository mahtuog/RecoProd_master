Works great, fits better. Works with a range of headsets. I use it with a jawbone iciness and a jabra extreme. The gels are comfortable, and fit quite well. Before buying these I was seriuosly thinking of a custoel. Th ese are almost the well fitting. Biggest issue is that the material hardens and may need replaced in about 6 months, but for the price I can live with that.
