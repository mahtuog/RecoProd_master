I read reviews before I buy products, and I was a little scared to buy this phone because everyone kept saying the battery life was really bad, the camera button always gets pushed "accidentally" in your pocket, and the sound is really bad (in the headset). Well, after I bought the phone and used it, none of these became a problem. The battery life is fine - those people probably got some of those recalled lithium-ion batteries. Also, when my phone is closed, the keypad automatically locks so my camera button does not take pictures of my packet, or whatever. The headset is a little low, but then if you use the "volume up" button, it gets louder (gee, what a concept). Also, some people have complained about the camera being "grainy." It's a 1.3 megapixel camera phone - which is pretty standard at this time. Some phone have a 2 megapixel or possibly 3 megapixel camera, but they are more expensive (by the way, the less megapixels, the more storage, so I like that I can put more songs on my phone for ringtones).There are the 6131 and 6133 phones available, and they have FM radios, but does anyone even listen to the radio anymore? Also, the phones say what carrier they have on them. This one says Cingular, the 6133 says T-Mobile, and I think the 6131 says Sprint, but the 6131 and 6133 are only available in the UK and shipped from there, so I don't know if they have the same GSM coverage (this is a Quad-Band phone, and the others may be Tri-Band).Long story short, works great, and has clip-on covers avilable so no scratches will occur! Also, if I get bored looking at black, I can change it whenever I feel like =)
