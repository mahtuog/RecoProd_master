There is on extremely important reason I chose this earpiece "COMFORT". This unit is so comfortable and secure in the ear you forget it is there. I tried a couple of the motorola units and they were not nearly as comfortable. They kept falling off the ear and when I moved my head from side to side they would swing off the ear. This unit sits behind the ear very unobtrusively.As for the functionality this unit is very easy work. The setup is quick and easy. Bur this probably depends on what phone you have. The sound quality is good and the battery life is excellent. Don't waste your money on a cheaper earpiece buy this one.
