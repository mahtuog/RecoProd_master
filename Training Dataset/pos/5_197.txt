I've used this case for over a year now. I carry my palm all the time in my jeans pocket, it goes everywhere with me. I've even dropped it a few times.The catch that holds it closed works well, not hard to open (though with two hands). If I stick too many receipts in the back of the case the catch won't catch.Possible downside? The hinge opens along the long side like a book, so if you use it oriented that way the case kinda gets in the way. If you use it turned the other way (my preference) the case sits nicely in my hand for writing-awesome.Never used the belt clip, I've had terrible luck with those things no matter what they're attached to (phone, ipod, whatever..)
