I just love this product. As noted in other reviews this unit does have some flaws and short comings but if you are not asking them to do more then they were made for I think they are wonderful.I purchased this to do three things(1) lissen to my audio books on my Zen Micro:This has been great, sound quality is very good, I can usually get 30ft indoors with out interruption. A great added bonus is when I sinch up the headphones to there smallest size they end up just shy of covering my left ear so I can use them while driving (against the law in FL to drive with both ears covered).(2) my phone a Treo 650:These have been the best phone head sets by far. I have not been able to find one of the smaller ones that I can really hear well (have tried several). People are usually very supprised to find out I was using a headset. Answering a call is pritty seamless, would be nice if it would pause my mp3 player but thats my players fault.(3) to use at home to lissen to TV after my wife goes to bed.This has worked out wonderfully, except the half second delay. It may even be less. I have not had any problems with loud sound effects in movies or with music.Other then that can creak alittle, may have tighten up a couple screws, they have been great!
