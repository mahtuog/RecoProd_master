I have had this for about 2 months and and love the case and it seems to be holding up to my rough treatment, however about 2 weeks into owning it, I realized there was a scuff mark on my Treo starting to form. It is right near the ear-piece, I thought I may have dropped the phone or something, but over the next few weeks it began to get worse, I finally realized that it lined up perfectly with the snaps that are inside of this case covering small pockets for caring items. After noticing this I began putting the phone in with the screen facing out, and the antenna pointing forward, does not appear to be making a scuff mark on the back of the phone.Overall a well constructed case, but if you are concerned about the appearance of your Treo make sure you put it in with screen facing out.
