I use Pulsar 590A just for a couple of days. I use it as stereo headphones and Skype headset for my PC (via Bluetooth 2.0 dongle) and as stereo headphones for my Pocket PC Dell Axim x50v (which has built-in Bluetooth 1.2). Setup in both cases was quite painless and quick. I also used the Bluetooth adapter that comes with the headphones, and it worked without problems.Until now I have just two serious issues with this product:1) Sound quality, in my opinion, is not satisfactory for music listening2) Flashing blue light on the right headphone - it is reflected on my PC screen when I watch movies and makes me look weird when I'm on the bus
