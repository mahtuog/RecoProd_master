The FreeSpeak is no doubt a reasonably good performer. The sound on it is reasonably clear and the microphone does a good job too. My only complaint on it is that once I paired mine and turn the kit on, my PDA (a Sony Clie PEG-UX50) would no longer be able to connect to the phone (a SonyEricsson T610) via bluetooth unless the kit is switched back off. Could be a flaw with either the phone's design and/or the Bluetooth specification (I never really did test it with a different phone to verify the problem), but since I am able to receive calls while my PDA is connected to the internet (I have GPRS enabled on my line), it would be nice to be able to answer a call without either talking on my phone or taking the PDA offline. Still, a good starter kit if you don't have any other Bluetooth device paired with your phone.Update: Well, I've managed to get a Motorola V600 and tried the same headset on it, and the same problem persists- you can't connect other Bluetooth devices to the phone while the headset is connected. I am now also fairly certain that the problem is with Bluetooth's specifications as I was unable to exchange pictures between the phones while the PDA was accessing one of the phones. So, okay. No fault of the phones, PDA or the headset. Just the way Bluetooth works in general.
