I have used these headsets for more than 4 years with my iPod classic, iPod Touch and a variety of Bluetooth cell phones. They are easy to pair, feel comfortable and the sound quality is very good. Battery life is fairly long - for my use, almost a week. The Bluetooth adapter that comes with 590A fits very snugly into the iPod 3.5 mm audio jack (unlike many others). Telescopic microphone is unobtrusive, works well on cell phones and the listeners at other end don't complain of poor voice quality.The main drawback of these headsets is their flimsy construction, cheap plastic. One of the cables became loose after a year and the plastic casing on one side cracked. So the sound from one side is intermittent now. But I was able to use it for 2 more years after taping it! Other cons include tiny and poorly placed controls - almost unusable while wearing headsets, very bright blue light and they do not cover the ears completely so there is no blockage of background sound.They are not the perfect Bluetooth headphones but in my experience they have worked better than the other ones that I have tried -ILUV i903 Noise-Canceling Bluetooth Stereo Headphones, Logitech andPlantronics 906/R US BackBeat Headphones. Finally, after 4 years, both sides plastic broke, and I had to replace them with Samsung WEP870 Bluetooth Headset (Black).
