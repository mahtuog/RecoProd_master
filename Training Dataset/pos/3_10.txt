Good product after I figured out how to use them. Works very well with the Samsung WEP200 headset. Came with no labels i.e., left, right, etc. or instuctions so took a little while to figure out how they would work. A small piece of paper with a few pictures and labels would have helped out tremendously. If my impatient son or daughter would have bought them they would have returned them as unuseable.
