The case design is awesome, but steer clear of the metallic version. It scratches easily. Now I've got the black version and LOVE it. I like how the case protects my entire Palm TX. Not one corner of my TX extends beyond the case so if I ever drop it, it may be jostled, but not totally destroyed. The cut outs give you ample room to work with when turning it off or on and using cords, memory cards, or the stylus. There's even a little cut-out in the back for the speaker. The case latch is solid and doesn't pop open. Inside, there's a soft felt lining and slots for 2 memory cards. I don't use the belt clip, so this case is just fine for me and the price is right too.
