I bought this phone to replace my T-Mobile flip phone. I inserted the sim and powered it up, just like I had read in all the reviews it powered up in chinese, took me 3 different areas to totally remove the chinese and have it read all english. Phone has excellent reception, 10mb internal storage and a FM radio to boot. I live in Texas and have had ZERO issues with the phone, it works just like the american edition. The phone is slim enough to fit in a shirt pocket, very sleek and easy to use.
