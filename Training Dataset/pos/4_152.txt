I got this phone over three years ago. It doesn't have many features, but it has worn like iron and that matters more. The lack of a speakerphone setting really annoys me, I'll admit, and so does the lack of a camera phone, but those weren't common features back in 2004. The vanity mirror is kind silly, but I have to admit that has been very useful to me over the years. (Which isn't to say a display in its place wouldn't have been more useful, but at least a mirror isn't totally useless to carry around.)Some people have said they have problems with reception using this phone. This has never been a problem for me, but the coverage area could have something to do with that. I actually get better coverage with this phone than most of my AT&T; friends do on their newer devices.After three years of use, I'm retiring this phone for an updated, unlocked phone. It has been dropped, rained on (heavily,) and even thrown long distances, but it still works fine to this day. A sick, girly, self-absorbed part of me is thinking, "What am I going to do now that my cell phone doesn't have a vanity mirror?" (Another part of me is psyched to finally have a camera-phone.)
