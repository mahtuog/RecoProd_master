I bought this based on reviews. I've always wanted cordless headphones but I didn't want ear buds because I wanted a better sound. These headphones are great. The sound is good. The price is good. Ive been using them for a month now and they are still in excellent condition. The other reviews are correct-the signal is still strong at 30 feet. The adapter also works for my tv so I can watch a movie while my wife sleeps and she doesnt have to hear the sound. The phone calls are clear on both ends. Only negative is that my ears get a little hot with the headphones but its winter now and I welcome it. July-Aug may be a different story.
