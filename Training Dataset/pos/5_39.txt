I finally settled on my Jawbone Era after using many bluetooth headsets. It is the loudest, clearest, and best noise cancelling headset of all.The only problem is that the earbuds that come with it really such. They don't fit well and hurt my ear. Also, I don't like using the earloop to hold it in place.This is where the Jabra eargels come in. Install the Jabra eargel on top of the small or medium earbud of Jawbone, and you're set.I couldn't love my Jawbone Era any more. It fits better. It is louder to the extent I actually have to adjust the volume.
