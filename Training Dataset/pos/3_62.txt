i got this phone about 3 months ago with cingular. i got one of those "go phones". my previous phone was a tmobile nokia 3595, i decided to go to cingular because tmobile did not have any service at my school. so far im happy with the phone but not cingular, my phone is out of minutes within 2 weeks when it should be 4, on my old phone it was 10 cents per txt message & im, and it was free to recive, cingular is 5 cents to send 5 cents to recive, at first i thought that was ok until i signed onto aim on my phone, i went on my computer and talked to my friends i felt my phone vibrate and it alerted me that i had used 5 cents, these messages kept coming for every message that i had sent on the computer, with my tmobile phone it would foward the ims to my cell but it would not charge me cause i did not use my phone i used my computer. also i had went upstate and i was roaming, since i had a prepaid plan i couldnt make or recive calls, with my tmobile i never roamedPros: downloadable games graphics and ringtones, can do everything a plan can do (prepaid plans), good service,Cons: Expensive, charges you a cent per gigabyte on internet, cant make calls when roaming (prepaid)
