I had previously purchased a similar item from a well-known chain store whose name ends in "-Mart". After about two weeks, the charger no longer worked. After making my purchase through Amazon, I've been totally pleased with this charger. I have not had any problems what-so-ever! I would definitely purchase from seller again!
