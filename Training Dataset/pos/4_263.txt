The dual ear piece is fantastic in a truck where the decimal level is very high. However, as good as it sounds in your ears, it needs to be balanced with a noise canceling microphone. Plantronics has some very good noise canceling microphones on some hard wired headsets that cost less money. It is quite reliable, comfortable and a charge lasts a long time. This is excellent in a low noise environment.
