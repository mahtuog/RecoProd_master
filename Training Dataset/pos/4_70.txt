It's cheap, eforcity delivers quickly, however, may not actually be OEM. All of the OEM chargers I've seen (model number SYN0847) has glowing stylized "M" motorola logo. This item, however, does not; it only has a small blue led underneath the "M" that glows when it's plugged in. All of the other labeling on the charger looks authentic Motorola. Maybe a really good knockoff? Anyway, does the job just fine (see title), and, again, it beats paying $20 at cingular.
