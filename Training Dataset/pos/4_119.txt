I think that it simply does what the manufacturer says it does, which is to protect the Palm, and in my case I've found that it is so. I use my Palm in my pants pockets, and I like the fact that it does not get scratches at all, like the Palm original aluminum case. It does not rattle the Palm because it fits snuggly, unlike the original case. It has a back opening for the tiny speaker, so I think you can hear alarms louder. I've used mine for a month and I haven't have any problem with the plastic hinges that others described. It is somewhat difficult to open, though, that's why I give it 4 stars. You can charge and synch the Palm without open this case, unlike the original one. I do recommend it.
