For use outside the United States especially in Africa, one always needs a quad band unlocked cell phone like this one. I ordered and received two of these from Amazon and shipped them to my folks in Africa. They received them with joy and they jumped into jubilation when they put in their sim card and it started working at once without ant hitch like decoding or anything like that. And they made a call from it to me here in the US. Amazing isn't it? One cousin was even crazy about the ability of the phone to receive the local FM radio transmission in Africa.So then for the L6i to be described as an "International Version", was proved right when my folks got their phone working. However for use in the US please go for the ordinary L6 without the 'i'. Hahahaaaaaa!!!For People traveling outside the US and for those who are here on a short visit if you are looking for gifts for friends and family I strongly recommend this low-priced phone with camera, internet, organizer, SD slot, and FM Radio. I bought some for my friends and they are in use right now. Please buy one or more today.
