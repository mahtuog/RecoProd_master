I've been using this product for about 6 months. My daughter borrowed it on a number of occasions to use with her iPod, and liked it. I felt good enough about the product to buy one for her for her birthday recently.My initial interest was listening to my computer, and to a lesser extent my iPod, without wires. RF type wireless headphones don't cut it for me, but these don't get static interference.The cellphone headset capability was an added bonus, but a nice one. I generally put my phone on speakerphone mode and wedge it against my sun visor. This works well for me. However, I recently used the Plantronics while talking to my parents during a drive home for about 15 minutes. It can be tricky to talk to them on the phone but this setup takes the quality of the sound up a notch and really helped.Don't expect you can be rough with it, but I've had no problems. There are some buttons and sync-delays and it is a wireless and bluetooth device. Don't think it is as simple as a wired device without those failure or configuration modes. It has not been a problem for me.I recommend this product.-CB-
