I just got this phone and there are some things that I love about it as well as some annoyances.I Love the design of the Razr. It easily fits into the pockets of my jeans. I like walking aound and not having a huge lump on my thigh. The keypad takes a little getting used to at first. After I used the phone for a bit, it feels just as natural as using any other phone.I have heard alot of people saying that the signal on the phone is horrible. I have had no problems with any dropped calls or calls breaking in and out even though i get very poor signal where i generally use my phone.The camera is aweful. Not that most phone cameras are very good to begin with but this one just irritates me. You have to hold the phone totally still for about 5 seconds while it takes the pix.Also, if you use a wired headset, you cannot use it if you are charging the phone. it only has one input and the charger as well as anything else you're going to plug into the phone go in there.All in all, i like it. I would reccomend this phone.
