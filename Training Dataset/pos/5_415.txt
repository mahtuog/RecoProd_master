this is an EXCELLENT phone. if you do your research, you will find that compared to the other phones currently offered at att, this one has the least amount of and least pressing quirks or issues.i love everything about this phone. the ease of use, the extensive cusomizations, the high quality sound quality and reception (which are obviously the two most important things in a phone after all... and this one really has the best of both of those things out of all 4 phones ive owned so far.) the bright, stunning screen... its a sleek, stylish, highly functional phone.the caveats of this phone, which are not numerous or severe enough to drop this review to 4 stars, are decent battery life, the 24 mb of memory... and that is honestly all i can think of.
