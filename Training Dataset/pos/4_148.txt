I've had the 1300i from Cingular for about a month now, and I love it! Everything is perfect about it, including the text messaging, internet, and LCD display. The only problem I've had with it is that I have had a couple dropped calls, but I barely have reception in my room anyway, so thats why. but GREAT phone!
