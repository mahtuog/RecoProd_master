Well it is a really nice bluetooth headset. Nice quality sound when I use it for my pc. I just couldn't make it work with my phone for songs without connecting the analog adapter. Which meant I had to carry it with me... so I had to return it. I think my phone is not compatible with stereo bluetooth or something like that. If you are buying this for your phone, please check for compatibility before making the purchase:) Good luck!
