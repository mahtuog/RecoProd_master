So I was looking for a stand for my desk at work, I was really tired on laying my BlackBerry down & having it lost in a pile of papers or since I have a "work" setting not knowing who was calling until I picked up the phone. This seemed to fit the bill & the price was right so I went for it. SO glad I did! It's perfect for what I wanted, a simple yet nice stand that keeps my BB upright at a good angle & the best part is that it will hold it while it's in the silicone sleeve! It's made of a nice leather & magnet system so if you need to travel with it, it will hardly take up any room at all, it folds totally flat. It even has "BlackBerry" imprinted across the front, something I hadn't noticed when I ordered it, it's a nice touch. It also has 2 holes in the back flap, I'm guessing it's so you can thread the charging cord through to keep it neat. If you're looking for a subtle phone holder that will look good on probably any desk I'd highly recommend this one.
