I posted a review earlier saying it didn't charge well. Since then Amazon sent me another one and it works great! I hear the people I'm talking to loud and clear. The people I'm talking to don't even realize I'm using a headset. It fits well in my ear and it charges well. Even the blue tooth synchronization was simple to set up for my razor.I highly recommend this headset!
