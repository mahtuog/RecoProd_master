Searching the brick and mortar stores yielded little more than frustration. Most places wanted sums more than $30.A few clicks on Amazon revealed a more affordable alternative to being "a slave to retail".I paid a fraction of the cost and it was delivered to my front door.If I HAD to have it at that moment, I would've had to drive 45 minutes out of my way to save $5 over the "manufacturers suggested retail price".Thankfully, I was able to exert a little control over my compulsion and saved 5x that amount. At the cost of a weekend of waiting for the mail.
