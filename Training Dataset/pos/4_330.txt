I bought this phone in Aug 04 and have generally been very happy with it.The battery life is not as long as my wife's phone, but I have talked up to 4 hours in a day without any problem. I generally recharge it after 2-3 days and average about an hour of talk time each day. Even down at one bar, it works fine.The size is great! I really wanted a phone that I could drop into my pocket and not need a bulky case in order to protect it. The V3m fills the bill perfectly. I also really enjoy that there is no external antennae. The mp3 player works fairly well, but it does not have all the features of a dedicated MP3. It will let you put together playlists and play songs, which is enough for me.The most important thing with a cell phone (to me) is call quality. This is where I have been the happiest. I have used it in the St Louis area, small town SW Oklahoma, Fort Worth, along I-40 to California, and now live about halfway between San Francisco and Sacremento. Call quality is crystal clear with no static!Overall I am very happy with the phone.
