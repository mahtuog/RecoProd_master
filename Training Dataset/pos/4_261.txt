received this headphones this morningthe headphones is comfortable and firm (earpieces may be kinda tight)it also comes with USB charge cable, regular headphones cable (used when it's turned off as regular headphones), AC adaptor, charge stand (I don't use it anyway), a casethe sound is pretty good, whether through wireless or hard-wired, bass is full and deep, mid and treble are well-balanced, since it's fully open air design, it should be pretty comfortable when listening (no hollow effect), and the sensitivity is pretty high when hard wired (single battery walkman is OK)the analog audio adaptor is another plus, it can also be used with moto HT820 (same passcode)the RF of the headphones is good as well, it claims 10m radius range, it really has 10 meters, I can get even more range with class 1 bt adaptorI worried about the hinge breakage, but after examine, I found out why: when you use charge stand, fully extend the headband, and let the earpieces face each other to prevent breaking, or simply use AC adaptor or USB charge cable directly (the jack is located on the left)the handsfree works pretty well with nokia 6270, loud and clear on both sidesno dropoffs on a2dp with T-Mobile MDA and Dell X51v, about audio lag, I notice all bt a2dp clients have same issue (moto HT820, itech R35)the only thing I don't like is buttons layout, the volume control should be located up and down, but now they're located left and rightconclusion: this model is one of the few over the head bt headset, and this one works exceptionally well, the money is pretty worth spent, I'd give 96/100, better than 91/100 for HT820
