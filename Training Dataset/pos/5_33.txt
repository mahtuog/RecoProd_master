"Jabra EarGels are designed to channel sound directly into the ear for perfect reception, so conversations sound clear and natural at both ends of the call. They are made of a translucent = BLUE =, soft material shaped to sit snugly in your ear for a comfortable and secure fit. Jabra EarGels are hygienic and washable and come six in a pack - three sizes for left and right ears."That is from the Jabra website. I just added something to the blue so it would stand out and put it in CAPS. That's probably why you guys are having problems, maybe they are fakes (the clear ones). Thought I would mention it. I haven't bought any but was looking into it. What bluetooth earpieces does it fit?
