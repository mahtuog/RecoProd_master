I have had this case for about 7 months and I am satisfied with its performance. It is well built and has protected my TX from damage. The Palm fits snugly and the case closes securely. The memory card slots are a nice touch, and the openings allow for access to all ports without opening the case.I can't comment on the sturdiness of the belt clip. I took it off the first day, as I usually carry my Palm in my shirt pocket.Cons: The case is very slippery so I stuck on some 3M non-skid strips to keep it from slipping out of my hand.I also wish the front cover opened and folded over the back, rather than just over 180 degrees.You have to watch the hinge pin, as it has a tendency to work its way out.I consider these to be minor shortcomings and I would recommend this case.
