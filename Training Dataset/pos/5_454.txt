Great toy! Sound quality is very good. Allows you to listen to music from your ipod and take a call when it comes in. Good for hands free driving which is a current issue for driver safety. As added benefit, this bluetooth adapter lets two people listen to your ipod music at the same time. With a spliter one line directly to headset and the other to adapter, the second person can listen to what is on ipod and then take calls. This works great for my wife and I when we take walks.
