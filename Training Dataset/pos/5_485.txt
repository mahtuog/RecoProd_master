After using an OEM case that was far too large, I found this case on Amazon and just finally ordered it. Smaller web-based vendors can be iffy, but the case arrived when it was supposed to, and it was packaged very well for shipping.I was very pleased with the quality of the case, first off. The leather is soft and well-stitched. It fits the phone very snugly without making it impossible to get the phone in and out. I like the vertical style cases more than the horizontal, and the swivelling belt clip is very sturdy. The flap is easy to open with one hand, and it doesn't interfere with accessing the phone.The case also uses the magnets to put the phone into standby, which saves battery life and talk time. The design is obviously for the Pearl, as it leaves all the important jacks and ports accessible while the phone is still in the case.You can't go wrong with this case if you need a basic, well-crafted, good quality case.
