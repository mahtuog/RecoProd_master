I tried two other Bluetooth headsets before this one. Both of the prior ones didn't fit right, were hard to hear, and provided poor voice quality (despite being made by a major vendor). I was about to give up after multiple trips to BestBuy, and decided to give Amazon a try (since the local BestBuys were out of Jabra products -- and now I see why). The Jabra arrived, and saved the day! It charged right up in its cool cradle, matched with the phone (Treo 650) immediately, and fit beautifully. It's lightweight, you can hear the people you're calling, and you sound great to them. I'm very impressed by the design (fit, form factor, buttons, charger) and utility. What a find!
