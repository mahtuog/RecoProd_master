I am quite pleased with the product that I only got last week.The reason for this delay is that Amazon, strangely enough, does not deliver to Malta even though we are part of the European Community. It looks as if, since we are a small country, we are discriminated against!!!Anyway I had the item delivered to a friend in the states who in turn posted it to me at home. It got here safely but because of your bureaucracy, late.I therefore limit my purchases to exceptional items only: like this item would have costed 5 times as much in Malta.
