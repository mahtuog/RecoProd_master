This is the first and only bluetooth product that I have ever purchased....so I don't have anything to compare to. I would just say that for the money (19.95 + tax) that this product is well worth the money. I have great reception and everone can hear me very well and I can also hear anyone that I'm talking to very well.I have read many other reviews about this product and I don't have any of the problems that everyone else is having. The unit fits snug in my ear and it isn't loose at all. I have had to run yet while wearing it, but, I feel that if I had to that the unit would stay put. I haven't actually measured the distance that I can get from my Sony Eriksen Z525a phone but I feel that 20-30 feet is accurate and still maintain reception.My wife has a Motorola H500 bluetooth product that she uses with a Motorola phone. I feel that my Nextlink AX2 performs just as well and is about $30.00 cheaper in price.I would recommend the Nextlink AX2 highly.
