This is a great extended life battery. Works great and the price is fantastic. The only thing you should know is that it is thicker than the normal battery and that is why it comes with a new back cover. It adds about a quater of inch to the thickness of the phone. For me this is a good trade off for the longer talk time and is not an issue at all.
