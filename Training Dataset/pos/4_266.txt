I've have this headset a month now for use with my Ipod, and it certainly is a keeper.Pros:- Easy to use- Amazing range, I've been out to 50ft.- Good volumeCons:- Charging setup. While the headsets fit into a nice charging stand, the transmitter dangles at the end of the charger cord, not very elegant. I'm also questioning the longevity of the "snap plugs" that are used for the power connection.- Volume is good, bass response is excellent and the headphones have crisp high-end response. I occasionally pick up some digital artifacts on extended high-frequency notes...a group of strings playing in the upper register, for example. With Bluetooth headsets in general, I have heard much worse. This is not a deal-breaker, and I am a bit of an audio snob.While it does work quite well in mobile phone applications, It makes for a pretty geeky fashion statement. I have used it only occasionally as a communication device.A nice, well engineered bluetooth headset.
