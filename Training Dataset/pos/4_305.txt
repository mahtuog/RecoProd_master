Nice case, I bought it mostly so the phone won't fly apart when I drop it. The case covers the power button for the phone, but the power button still works fine through the case.I have a charging stand to hold my phone upright while it's charging. The case has a cutout for the charging socket, but because of the thickness of the leather, the phone doesn't connect with the charger. You can still use the travel charger, but to use the desktop charger I'd need to take the case off.
