I bought this product as a replacement for my often broken computer headsets. The battery life is great, good sound, and great microphone. The only thing I wasn't aware of is that you can't use stereo sound and voice at the same time. You can easily switch between the two with your control panel however, so its not a game stopping issue, just not the fabled PC Headset replacement we're all hoping for.
