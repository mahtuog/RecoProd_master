As suggested by another reviewer, I purchased these ear gels to go along with my Jawbone, to assist in keeping the bluetooth headset in my ear and on my head. Unfortunately, contradictory to what the other reviewer indicated, the ear gels did not even come close to fitting over the ear piece on the Jawbone, and thus were pretty much useless to me. In fact, one of the gels even split open as I was trying to make it fit over the earpiece on the Jawbone. Maybe it's because I have smaller ear, and I had to use the smallest one, but it totally didn't work for me. Oh well, at least they weren't too expensive.
