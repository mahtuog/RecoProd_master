I really enjoy my new phone, switching cell # from Cingular to Verizon was simple, and the voice activation is a great feature. My main disappointment is the lack of battery life it has...3 hours is not a long time. My old Cingular phone allowed days of talk time before having to recharge. What good is a phone and plan if you can't use it longer than 3hrs of talk time and always worried you are going to lose connection. Other than that, the phone and features are great.
