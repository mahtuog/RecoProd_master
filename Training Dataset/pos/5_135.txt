This Motorola phone charger for the car works great! There is a blue light that lights up when the ignition is turn on. (blue is my favorite color.) the cord is not too long, but long enough for you to chat comfortably on. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a motorola razor phone. The price was unbeatable so cheap.When I ordered it, it arrived so fast that I could not believe it. Once again great product.
