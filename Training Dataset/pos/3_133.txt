This headset works really well with the stereo music player on my phone (the LG CU500) but I find myself using it less and less simply because the headset is so clunky, and that stupid gigantic blinking blue light makes me look like a geek. I'm now in the market for a new headset that's more low-key in appearance and more stylish....
