It is better than my T720 which just clunked out on me this week. I can hear other people fine with just one bar of signal. However they can't hear me I plan to test it out more tomorrow when I have a stronger signal at work. It is easy to use. I can not use it inside my house. But the only phone I have ever been able to ues inside here was on MCI. I love this phone. My fav extra feature is the alarm clock. I even goes off if the phone is powered off!!!
