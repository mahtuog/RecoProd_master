The crystal case is very good. Especially the smoke color gives my phone a good feel. Good protection overall I should say. Arrived promptly. Doesnt feel like a cover at all (like someone already mentioned)Downside -No Screen protectionA bit thick (which makes it sturdy). But could have used a tougher and thinner material to make it really sleek.Overall, a great buy for my pearl 8100
