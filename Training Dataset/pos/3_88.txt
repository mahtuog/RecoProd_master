I bought this for my Treo 700p. When new, it looks reasonable. The material is worn down in some areas after 3 months of use. I didn't need the pocket inside for memory cards but the button has scratched my Treo right on the Treo logo. It is disappointing to buy a device for hundreds of dollars then to have a cheap case scratch it. I flipped my phone around in the case so it is now scratching the back.The belt clip is a sturdy and strong pinching type clip. It does not clip around a belt but it has not popped off of my belt yet. The strong pinching type has scratched my belts (since pinches so firmly) and has pulled apart the material of one belt. I prefer clips that reach around a belt to clip and hold the pouch in place.I will probably look for a better case for my Treo. Overall I can't recommend this case.Unfortunately most cases are poorly made and break easily. My search will not be easy.
