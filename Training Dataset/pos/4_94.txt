Don't let the picture fool you, this headset does not have an weird space age antenna. It is actually a really cool device to keep the headset in your ear without having the big bulky over the ear rubber piece that is supposedly one size fits all. The AX2's funny looking earpiece is ajustable and can be cut to fit almost any ear. As far as the quality, are their better headsets out there... Yes, but are there better headsets out there for the money, I don't think so. I put a strong buy on this BT headset.
