From all the reviews and product info on Amazon, it was hard for me to tell if these were meant to work with any other headsets besides the JawBone. I went ahead and ordered and very glad I did. These work great on my Jabra BT530. Comfortable fit, holds securely, much more satisfied now with using BT, just wish they didn't make me look so douchy. Just too darn handy.
