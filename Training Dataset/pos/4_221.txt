Length:: 3:02 MinsLike itsbig brother, the Boxwave mini-stylus has a superb tip for today's capacitive touchscreens (older-style, hard styli won't work on them). In winter, when you've got gloves on -- nothing better. Also like the larger model, it attaches to your mobile device with a plug that fits in the 3.5mm audio jack. This little nub stores neatly in a small case with the phone, but its short stature makes it a bit uncomfortable for extended use: finger cramps ahoy! PDApanache and other makers offered telescoping barrels that solved the "almost-gone piece of chalk" syndrome, I'd give a fifth star if this stylus extended in length. But it's still a great tool for keeping your smartphone or tablet screen clean, and is probably more accurate than your finger for "touch typing" an on-screen. For the (current) price, I think it's a quite a bargain.
