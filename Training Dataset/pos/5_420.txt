This is an excellent phone, with a long battery life, solidly built. The keypad is one of its best features, the buttons are comfortably arranged and of a good size for text messaging. The internal memory is larger than that of the V3, with 10 MB. It is enough for storing a reasonable amount of ringtones and pictures. It is mp3 capable. You need to buy an external cable and use Motorola Phone Tools though to be able to exchange data between your PC and the V191.
