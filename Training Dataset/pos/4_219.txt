I just bought the Jabra BT250 and have only been using it for about a week now. It has a bit of delay when you answer or place a call but it is tolerable. I have always had a very hard time finding earphones that fit me and will stay in my ear (from cell phone earbuds to mp3 players). This fits very securly and comfortably. Easily could forget I have it on. Have only gone about 20 feet from my phone but the phone was in my car with the door closed and I walked to get the mail... I did get a bit of static but perfectly usable. Occasionally I try to place a call and the Jabra doesn't seem to make the connection and I end up using the phone itself. But this has only happened less than 5% of the calls I've made. Easy to put on with one hand...while driving.Overall I'd say good buy only negative that I see so far is the occasional time when I can't get the Jabra to click on and receive the call.
