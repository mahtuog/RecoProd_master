Well constructed case, of good quality leather. Looks, works just fine. However, my wife broke the belt clip on hers in under 6 month, I broke mine in under a year. My guess is, if you never dropped your cellphone (is that possible?) you would never have any serious complaints with this case. I'm here, now, to order another one...and they're on sale! Hooray!
