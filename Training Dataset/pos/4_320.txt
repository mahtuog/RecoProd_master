This item was shipped in a timely manner and arrived in excellent condition. It was found this item far exceed the original headset. The tone quality is outstanding but sorry to say, the overall volume level is a bit low. Oh and BTW, a small box of Kellogg's Smart Start cereal was included within the shipping package. I do highly recommend this item.
