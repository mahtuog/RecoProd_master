got these for my JB prime....and they do the trick....i work outdoors out of my cable van all day.....and this holds my earpiece in place for a couple hours...till my ear hurts....the stock one wouldnt hold it in my ear and hurt alot worse.....had to use the round ear piece...not the one with the hoop in it....these slid right over....works great....
