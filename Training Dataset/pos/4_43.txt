With three different sizes and both left &amp; right options, almost everyone should be able to find a good fit within this package. Without a properly fitted earbud, the Jabra headsets just don't work well. I suggest you pick these up at this price, because they *do* tend to fall off every once in a while and disappear under the car seat. Having a spare on hand is a must.
