I have tried several models of pouches for my Treo, and this one beats all the others hands down. Other models have serious safety issues for the phone tends to fall out or the clip breaks or loosens. Others are bulky and unconfortable and others are difficult to use with one hand. This model I like because it keeps the phone well protected, it is easy to retrieve it with one hand and to put it back in. It is also well constructed, the leather is both good looking and durable, and the belt clip is very sturdy and durable as well. I have owned all other models, including the hard case, and this is by far the one I prefer. Highly recomended.
