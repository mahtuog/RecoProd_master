This case looks very good. It appears to be made of high quality leather. My treo sits well in it and is easy to put in and take out.The latch is magnetic, easy to open and close, and keeps the treo safe from the elements.It is little difficult to secure it on your belt the first few times. But then it gets easier. You do not feel like a big thing is hanging off of you :-)Highly recommended.
