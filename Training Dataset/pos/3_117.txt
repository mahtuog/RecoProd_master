I recently purchased this phone from AT&T; to replace my old, low-end Motorola V180 phone. I am a basic cell phone user; I make maybe 2-300 minutes of calls a month, send a few text messages, and that's about it. This time around, I wanted a phone with a camera and maybe an MP3 player, and the 6126 fit the bill.Pros:- Both screens are excellent. Large, bright, and colorful.- The user interface is good, much better than my old phone. It's more responsive and you can customize more of the phone's behavior. The address book is better designed.- Camera resolution (1.3MP) is higher than other similarly-priced phones.- Call quality is good. It sounds better than my old phone and gets better reception.- Looks and feels nice. With its rubberized exterior and denseness (like an iPod), it feels high-quality. The keypad is raised and has good tactile feedback.Cons:- The battery life is terrible. My old V180 would last a whole week on standby, and it was the cheapest phone you could buy; my 6126 lasts 2-3 days. I fear how bad it's going to be when the battery starts to wear out.- All the wired connections are proprietary, so you won't be able to use your standard USB cables, old wired headsets, or even normal headphones. Sure this phone can play MP3s, but are you really going to carry around a set of Nokia-specific headphones to do that? This part really annoys me, the MP3 player portion is useless IMO and was one of the major reasons I picked this phone. This complaint doesn't apply if you have Bluetooth accessories, though you still can't use the MP3 player (no A2DP profile).- Camera quality is poor. Apparently this is generally true for cell phones.- Speaker volume is low.Overall, I'm ambivalent on this phone. I like the design and features, but the battery life and proprietary connections really annoy me.
