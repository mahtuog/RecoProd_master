I have only had this cable for about two months so have not noticed any of the 'wear and tear' on the cable line as mentioned in other reviews. The cable has functioned great for me.It is also in a nice convenient, compact size that allows me to carry it with me to the office and on the road. If it continues to perform as it has been I would say this is a great buy for those on the go.
