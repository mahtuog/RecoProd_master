Bought this gift for my husband for Christmas. He is a driver and loves to listen to music. The sound is awesome! The blue light is not a problem at all, which is something I was concerned with due to reading other reviews. My husband uses it with his Ipod and cell phone and says it was his favorite gift. His friends at work were also impressed and wanted more information on it. A great buy!
