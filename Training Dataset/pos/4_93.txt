Good value for the money...best I have tried so far...incredible talk and standby time...includes 2 chargers...USB and AC wall...clear sound quality... as with almost all bluetooth sets wind noise outside degrades sound quality for listener on other end...in car with windows up...clear as a bell and thats what was important to me..also suprised at sound quality in stores ect...overall a very good buy for the buck!...Jon
