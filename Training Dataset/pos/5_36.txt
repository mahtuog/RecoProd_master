If you have trouble getting your Jawbone to fit like I did, these may be a good solution for you. The largest one worked great for me. I wear it without the ear loop now. However, you can do a number of different combination with/without earloop and with/without the original ear buds attached to achieve your perfect fit. The other nice thing is that these sit in your ear and blocks out more outside noise so you can actually hear better. I found myself turning the volume down a bit after using these.
