For me, it fits well on my jawbone1. I just had to take off the jawbone ear hanger and ear piece, and put this rubber earpiece over it. When it's in my ear, I can jump up and down (not that there's a usual reason to) and it doesn't come off. I'm using the largest size for the right side. Just don't keep it in the car when it's hot outside, the rubber might get a little soft and come off the Jawbone. let it cool and it's back to normal.
