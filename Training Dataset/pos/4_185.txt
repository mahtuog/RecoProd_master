I have used my Mustek Bluetooth headset with my laptop for VoIP calls without any problem on the part of the headset. I use Skype for calls, and once my B.T. preferences were configured, the Skype program allowed me to select my headset for both audio input and output. I use it infrequently (15 min. calls every few days) and have not needed to recharge it YET. This may not be standard for everyone but it is a good product to keep around as it is very useful with my calling situation.It is suprisingly light and fits comfortably on the ear with no discomfort after a few minutes use. The user guide is easy to understand and makes set-up very simple.I would recommend this headset without reservation as this product is not a big name in phone gear, but provides very good service for the price. The sound quality is good for all calls, but I have not paired this with a bluetooth cell phone, and have no baseline for quality. With Skype, there is a loss of quality due to Skype's limitations, but I cannot see this having much effect on call quality with a cell phone.
