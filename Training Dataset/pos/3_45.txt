I love this thing and my wife loves her's too. Unfortunately, my first one died (replaced under warranty luckily). The units also suffer from occassional echo and really odd static.However, it is really cool and I still love it! Very comfortable to wear and easy to use. Maybe I should be more generous with my stars considering the price and the coolness, but I hate when things break on me even if they are replaced.
