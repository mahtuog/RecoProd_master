Before buying this headset, I tried on practically every other headset on the market. None of them would stay on my ear. I have a small head and small ears, and I wanted something low profile that would stay on while I was walking. This headset is nice and snug and works great. I highly recommend it to anyone who has trouble finding headsets that fit.
