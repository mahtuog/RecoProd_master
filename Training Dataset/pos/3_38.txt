This was my first attempt with a Bluetooth headset and I came away with the "just not right for me" impression. The AX2 is very small, but sound quality is generally good, with one exception. While I could hear callers just fine, it was next to impossible for me to hear the verbal commands from the phone. I also had a hard time operating the volume buttons. The only way to change volume was to take the headset from the ear. Overall, not a bad headset, just was not the one for me.
