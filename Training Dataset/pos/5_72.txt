The problem that plagues the Jawbone is the fit. With these ear gels, the problem is gone and I don't need to use the ear hook. You will need to make sure that that the gel piece on the Jawbone touches your cheek and you will be good to go.I am using the Large sizes for my ears. Does anyone want to trade for the other sizes: small/medium? I figure that I'll never need those. Thanks.
