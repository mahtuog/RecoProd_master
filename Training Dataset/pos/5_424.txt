I purchased the Pulsar 590A 2 months ago. It is a terrific product. The sound is great. I purchased it to simultaneously connect to my ipod and Blackberry Pearl phone while walking. Again, I could not be more satisfied.In addition, Plantronics support is amazing. I asked them for the cost to just replace the adapter. I thought I broke it. They said it should be almost impossible to break with normal use. I got another Pulsar 590A headset and adapter without cost to me in less than a week.The unit is small and folds into a nice looking case. The light is no big deal. Very nice looking headphones. I do not understand anyone negatively reviewing this product.
