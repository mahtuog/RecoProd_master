I did a lot research before i purchased this phone. Upon customers' review, I knew the battery life would be short when i was purchasing. However, I didn't expect to charge my phone everyday. The battery bar went down to 1/4th after I made an hour phone call (the battery was full before i made the call). It's just ridiculous how short the battery life is. Plus, the user manual isn't helpful so much. I followed the maual to set and display the date/year. However, the date/year can only be displayed in internal screen not in external screen. So i need to open the phone to check the date every time, which is not convenient at all. Besides these two cons, Nokia 6126 is an excellent phone to use. The signal/reception is excellent. The speakerphone function works well too. The sound qulity is not bad either. Overall, Nokia 6126 is a good phone to use. Since i got this phone for free from ATT with 2yr agreement, I'm not gonna return it even i'm so dissatisfied with the battery life.
