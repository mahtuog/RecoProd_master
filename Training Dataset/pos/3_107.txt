Great product... but I bought it for my Treo 650. Jabra makes a different version which looks identical to the BT250 but is designed specifically for use with the Treo 650 and can be purchased at PalmOne's website. DO NOT BUY THE BT250 for the TREO 650. Go to www.palmone.com and buy it there - they are two different devices and the BT250 is severly limited in functionality when paired with the Treo 650.
