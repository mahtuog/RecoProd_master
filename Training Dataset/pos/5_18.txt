When I searched the net for a more comfortable ear piece for my jawbone era I came across this. I had read several mixed reviews about them. After a few more days of the era falling out my ear or my ear being super sore from the provided gels I took a chance.These are great. They are better than the jawbone ones in every way. They stay in my ear better. They are more comfortable. I can, also, hear the audio better.I give these five stars because they are perfect for me. If I were rating this for other folks I would probably rate it 4 stars because there are only 3 sizes. If you don't fit one it will be frustrating.
