Love phone. Sleak design and not over burden with bells and whistles. However, Amazon and Cingular (AT&T) need to better coordinate the option of extending your Cingular contract with purchase of new phone from Amazon. Cingular over charged me $59.99 a month for an additional new plan....instead of extending my "family plan" contract for 24 months. Cingular customer service was terrible, Amazon on the otherhand was great. It took a day or two but they gave me a special Cingular number and my problem was solved. A great deal on a new phone but watch your phone bill closely.
