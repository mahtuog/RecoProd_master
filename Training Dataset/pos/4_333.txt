I recieved this phone for free with the $200 credit once I completed my 1st contract with Verizon. I really like this phone, its hard not too. I like the brushed aluminum look and its a very well designed phone. The keypad is extremely nice and is SUPERIOR to other phones I've owned when trying to dial in the dark. The screens are both nice and bright and very clear. I've never had any connection problems with this phone, and callers voices sound very clear. The speakerphone works very nicely....loud if I need it to be and clear. VCAST is nice for downloading music and ringtones and games. Some of the stuff is a little expensive, so I rarely use it. I really hate the fact that this phone from Verizon is altered by Verizon so that you cannot put your own ringtones, pics, etc on the phone...but that is not something I can blame on Motorola. The battery does not last as long as other phones I've owned in the past, but it does get me through the day. I can use the USB cord that came with my MP3 player to charge the phone from my MacBook Pro...I find that HIGHLY convenient. All in all I really like this phone. Its nice to carry, look at and hold. Its also easy to use, despite its futuristic design and new technology.
