Purchased this as a replacement for an old phone.The original battery had sat in the phone for about 2 years, and was no longer any good.Once I began using this I was very happy with the battery life. With my normal daily routine with checking emails, texting, and the occasional phone call, not to mention my daily alarm, the battery life lasts about 2 days.I have had this batter now for several months, and I am still very pleased with the quality of this.
