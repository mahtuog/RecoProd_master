I used this together with a Nokia 6600 and it worked well communication-wise however it is a little bulky and can get a little uncomfortable if worn for too long. I had no real problem with the ear pieces which are quite sturdy and they have an extra one included as well. Given the wireless headsets that are currently out there which are smaller and more comfortable I'm not sure if these will be popular for long though.However, this particular one works as advertised and perfectly with my Nokia 6600.
