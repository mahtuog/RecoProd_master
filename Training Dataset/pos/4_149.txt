This is a simple to use, small, light and generally elegant flip phone, with good reception.Some useful comments for those interested in getting it:-It looks nice and has a fast and responsive user interface (I found the LG interface much better than the Samsung x426). It is easy to move from menu to menu by pressing the shown number (or scroll around and press select if you want).-Some useful functions are hidden away under three menu levels (ie Calculator, Alarm, Calendar). There is no way to assign a shortcut. There are built-in shortcuts to internet, text messaging, contacts, instant messaging.-It is easy to put the phone to vibrate, even without opening it.-The light on the outside lights red if there is a waiting message (voice or text) but not when you have missed calls.-You cannot use most of the phone's functions when talking on the phone. (ie you cannot play games if you have a headset and are having a boring conversation.) But you can take a 'note' and later save it as a phone number.-The phone can only &quot;ring and vibrate&quot; at the highest volume.-The volume control for the games is tied to the volume of the ringer. So if you lower the volume while playing and forget to increase it afterward, the ringer will be quiet. Also, if the phone is set to loudest ring, some menu confirmation will elicit a loud sound from the phone (ie entering a new contact.) This is annoying.
