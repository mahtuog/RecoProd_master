I've had mine for over a year now, so I thought I'd offer some comments.First, buy a case. This is not a particularly tough phone. My teenage son killed his within six months. Then again, he was always tossing it around and dropping it. I've dropped mine too, but the case has kept it looking good.This is a small phone. If you've got big fingers as I do, it may give you some difficulty. I wouldn't buy a smaller phone, but this one fits nicely about anywhere.The display is quite bright once you get the settings right. Perversely, the display is best with the wallpaper off and the brightness "down." When you turn it up, it just washes the text out.The alarm clock is fine, and the aftermarket accessories available for interfacing with a PC work well enough with a little fiddling. I've loaded my own MIDI files as ringtones. Not all of them load correctly, so you'll have to experiment with that.The speakerphone isn't particularly powerful from the user end, but the person you're talking to seems to hear you well enough.All in all, a decent - but not outstanding - phone. I've looked at others but, for now, have stayed with my little Nokia.
