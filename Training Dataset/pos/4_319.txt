I prefer to travel as light as possible with as few wires as possible. This is a wonderful design for a cell phone charger. I have used this with Ericsson T39, T600, R520, and several other phones with compatible connector. Although the conector is US/China style, you can add a mini plug changer for use in other places like Europe, UK/Hong Kong, etc. It supports standard voltage worldwide.
