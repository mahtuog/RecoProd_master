I really like this product. It is small and does well even when I have my coat on, which covers my phone up. there are a few troubles in windy outside condidtions, but I had troubles with the wired headset I used to use. The Blue Spoon is awesome and works great as promised. The people I have talked to on it have said they don't have complaints about how I sound using the Blue Spoon.
