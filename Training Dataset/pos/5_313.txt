I always want to protect my phone, and this case does just that.Pro:If covers majority of the phonethe back is a hard material (probably cardboard)Comes with a clip for your belt (which I have no used)COns:It makes the keyboard much smaller, have to get use to the leather being close to the side of the keyboard.bit of a hassle plugging the phone in.The price.The notification bar is kinda hard to drag down.If you don't mind the cons and want to protect your phone, then I would suggest buying this.EDIT::: Dec 22, 2010Well it has been over a little of three months since I had the case and I am now just noticing wear and tear. The side on the front right have been detached and now I can see the cardboard. The flap that "keeps it in place" is now tearing (just the sides). The front left side is tearing off and that is all I notice.
