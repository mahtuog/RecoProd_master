C1300i is the upgraded version with better reception now. Just got it so no comment on the battery life but one of the web review praise the battery life and reception.This one I just got has a bad text LCD screen that is hard to read but the graphic screen is bright and clear. Weird.Will go back to Cingular store to get it fixed or exchanged.
