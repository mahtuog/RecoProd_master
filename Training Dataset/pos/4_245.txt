Had my VX8500 for about a year now, and am pretty satisfied. I bought a 2GB card for it, and use it constantly to listen to MP3s and books. It couples well with my Jabra BT8010s, and has very good sound quality for music and calls.The camera is pretty good too. With the right light, it can take some very nice pictures.The touch controls work very well on mine, and were very easy to get used to.It's even been inadvertantly dunked in a glass of diet pepsi, and still works like a charm (after it dried anyway).Battery life is great, if I don't use the MP3 player, the battery will last about 4 days on a charge (1 or 2 with heavy use).Build quality is pretty good, but I am on a refurb unit now due to the fact that the screen on my first unit blanked out on me (Verizon happily dolled out a new one though).All in all, I'm pretty happy with the VX8500.
