First off, I like the stand and would buy it again. Its just not what I initially expected. My expectation from the pictures was this stand was rigid, but its not. When I received the order, I was really confused. It was delivered in a flat mail envelope. I was wondering if they sent me the correct item. After opening the package, the stand was flat and needed to be folded at the creases. Once folded correctly, 2 internal magnets keep the stand from unfolding. The only issue I have is my 8310 doesn't fit as snug in the stand as I would like. But it doesn't fall out. Other than that, the construction and quality are top notch.
