I purchased my BT250 in the spring in the UK before it was released in the US. I use it with a Nokia 3650.I find the comfort excellent and the range is better than some other reviewers have reported. I once left the in the trunk of my car (VW Jetta) and plugged the headset in anyway. The phone did ring and it sounded fine. On the other hand, I have had breakup when the headset is on one ear and the phone is clipped to the opposite hip.One voice quality, I regularly dial into conference bridges in the UK from the US on my headset while driving. I have no problems being heard.Battery life has been great. I charge mine only a couple of times a month. Mine was advertised with eight days standby time and I turn it off after my commute to work (about 1 hour each way). When I travel I leave the charger at home.I do not use voice tags or voice dialing so cannot comment on this point.
