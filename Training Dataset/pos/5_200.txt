This is my second metal TX case (the other one was a different brand). I did my research before buying it and was accidentally shipped the wrong case. So I got to see what another case was like and I have a much greater appreciation for this one.Let me tell you, this one is excellent. I do not and will not use the belt clip, so I cannot vouch for that portion. Due to the excellent padding and fit, My PDA is very snuggly settled in the case. The case allows access to all of the TX features. It is very sturdy, protective, and adds very little bulk or weight to the PDA. The case will easily open if you are trying to open it, otherwise it stays closed. The case also has four tiny points on the bottom of it that will raise the case off the surface, so that if you are playing music, you can hear it with the speaker side down to the surface. It even has a tiny access hole to the reset button.I highly recommend it if you are scared of ever dropping your PDA or simply just want to protect you delicate, yet fairly expensive piece of equipment.
