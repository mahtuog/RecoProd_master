Stop fooling around with clipped conversations and embarrassing lost calls. Its so nice not to worry if you have enough juice to finish the call, or sweat the fact that you forgot to charge the phone last night. With this battery it'll wait till tomorrow. Just checked mine after two days off the charger. The phone still shows a fully charged battery. I have never had this battery go dead in use.My only concern was if the larger size would require a larger phone holder. It adds only a 1/8 inch in thickness, if that. The back fits just as well as the OEM, same color and everything. This is an easy decision.
