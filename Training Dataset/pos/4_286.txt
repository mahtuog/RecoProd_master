The soft leather case contains a built in magnet, which when inserting your blackberry phone, powers down the screen, placing the phone in standby mode, without your doing anything other than placing the phone in the holster. Flap over the top of the phone also has a magnetic latch, not the strongest in the world; however, the phone will stay put even if standing on your head. Case has a swivel clip on the back, allowing adjustment in steps from vertical to horizonal (still secure). Only down side is the clip will only fit on belts up to 1-1/4" width (wider 1-1/2"+ cowboy types or thick holster width belts are too large for the clip), and the plastic can break if stepped on or laid on with enough weight. Make sure it is shipped in a box, not a pouch for that reason (it can arrive broken, but someone in shipping does have to work at it, if it's not in a pouch. First one for blackberry several years ago was almost $30,, when you can find a deal on Amazon's dealer like Unlimited Cellular, at less than $10 plus shipping it is a bargain..
