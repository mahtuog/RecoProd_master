This phone is one of the best I've ever had! The design is great as are the controls. You can silence/vibrate it w/o opening it (and vice-versa). I have dropped it onto concrete before and there were no scratches and it still worked fine. I never found any bugs or errors. Service is excellent and I have yet to have any problems with it.However, as others have stated you can't choose shortcuts- they are chosen for you. IM & text messaging are 2 of the chosen ones. Never the less, its still my favorite phone
