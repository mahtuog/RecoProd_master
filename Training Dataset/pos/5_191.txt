i had originally bought the motorola hs820. i was using it with a moto krzr. i don't know if my particular headset was faulty, but the sound quality was horrendous. everything sounded tinny and even synthesized. someone told me that bluetooth just doesn't sound right with a moto phone. i returned that and bought this headset anyway (it's so cheap and amazon returns are very simple, that i decided to give it another go). i was shocked when i saw how small it is (you don't realize just from the pictures). it's incredibly comfortable in my ear, and the sound quality is just as it is from the phone. no difference at all, and people on the other end don't notice i'm using a headset. i recommend buying this over any others. it's definitely worth it!
