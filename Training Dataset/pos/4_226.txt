You get what you pay for, and this headset has been awesome! The white and silver seems to be cheaper priced than the black and silver one (who knows why???), but I think the white one makes the headset less obvious!This headset fits perfectly on my small ears, it clamps on and has an ear piece that sits in your ear to hold it there. There is NO WAY this headset will move! It does not hurt my ear either.It has great reception, but you will have to use the headset in a quiet environment, so no sunroof or windows open. It picks up the external noise and you voice very well. It is perfect for the car, but dont try to use it at the mall or a rock concert.It works with my bluetooth enabled Razor phone. I tried the Motorola headset and it does not work nearly as well as this one, and this one is less expensive!
