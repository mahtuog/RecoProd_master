I am highly satisfied with this product. My original no longer maintains a good charge. I looked for a reasonable replacement and found it here.It fits perfect, charges well, and maintains a very long charge. Upon receiving the battery, I placed in my V555 and charged it, expecting it to take some 15 hours to charge initially. It probably took three to four. After two full days of use (voice and texting), the battery indicator still shows four bars (Full). My original battery would go dead in less than day with use.
