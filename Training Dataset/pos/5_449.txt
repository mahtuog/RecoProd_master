I purchased 3 sets of these over Christmas for gifts (one for myself) and I have to say they are amazing!! Sound quality is fantastic and works a treat with my bluetooth phone (and I have an obscure VK4000!! anyone heard of that model? - there you have it!!) All in all, these rock!!UPDATE: It's now the end of 2008 and these units still look and sound as good as the day I bought them and I use them nigh on constantly! No fragility problems as most of the time I just sling them in my tote. Turning the adapter on and off can be a bit of a manicure wrecker, but that is really the only flaw I have been able to find.
