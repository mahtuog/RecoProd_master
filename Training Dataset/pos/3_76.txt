This case protects the phone from scratches and also comes with a belt clip. It is a very inexpensive case, and it does its job. However, you get what you pay for. If you would like to pay a little more, I would recommend purchasing a krussel leather case. It protects the keys on the phone, and its a little nicer looking. The leather is a little nicer that this plastic case.
