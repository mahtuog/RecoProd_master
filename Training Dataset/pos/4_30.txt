I have been using in-ear bluetooth devices for a couple of years. My wife and daughter (of the small ear canal clan) had opted for over the ear designs because of fit and comfort issue. As it turned out, neither of them used their ear buds because of the loose/insecure fit and feel of the ear hanger design. The Jabra gels resolved that problem by 'sizing down' to match their diminutive ears . . . . It would be nice if you could order by specific size (s-m-l)and side (l-r) rather than getting the 'variety pack'.
