I purchased these EarGels for my Jawbone (JB) BlueTooth (BT) headset as most people I have spoken with swear by them. The ear loop provided by JB breaks when I put the BT device in my pocket and the plastic ear piece gets very uncomfortable after wearing it a short period of time.I took the plastic ear piece off of the JB only to discover that the hole in the EarGels are too big. Therefore the JB comes off quite easily.I put the most round plastic ear piece that comes with the JB back on the JB (there are different shapes- some round, some pointed to fit your ear better) as the pointy ear piece will obviously not fit well on the EarGel. This worked ok but now the EarGel would fall out of my ear with the JB attached. This same thing happened no matter what size EarGel I used. Not good either.After monkeying around with this for some time (and splitting one of the EarGels down the side), I have come to this conclusion. Most people will probably have to wear the ear loop with the EarGels as the EarGels are not really meant to be worn alone and/or cannot hold the JB headset on its own. The EarGels definitely feel much better than the hard plastic ear pieces that JB gives you. For the price of the JB, they ought to partner with Jabra and incorporate the EarGels with the JB headset.Bottom line, the EarGels are much better than what you get from the BT makers but are not the end solution for most people.
