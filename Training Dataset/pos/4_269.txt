After an hour of trying to use the headphones with my Macbook Pro 2.16 ghz using the bluetooth feature I almost gave up but found a forum that mentioned how to change the sound setting on the laptop. I did so and was able to listen to itunes. The audio was least to say "bearable" but really I would rather use my little walmart earbuds that aren't wireless if listening for a longer period of time. The audio is "bearable" in total because depending on your position from the laptop is a huge factor, and you can't move your head alot. For some reason I could only use them to listen to itunes and when I tried to listen to any web music like on imeem or youtube I got nothing! As a headset for bluetooth...well I tried to pair it with my htc touch pro and it didn't show up but well I would not even dare to step outside wearing these things, I could just get a sleek ultra cool little bluetooth headset even if its on one ear only.Other than the bluetooth problems if you use the universal adapter the audio is actually pretty good, along the lines of any $20 earbuds or wrap around ear phones (which is the only things I can afford and ever used...except for these which i received as a gift) and I could use any application and surf music all over the web and go as almost 30ft away from the adapter/laptop.For the cost of about 120+ I do recommend if the most important thing is having a wireless headphones. Blueooth capabilities are a shame but with the adapter then they are well worth it. Still if you are gonna fork over some cash you should look for something that is the best...for recommendations look at http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=235484
