I got this case for my husband about 3 weeks ago and it has worked great! The case has a good bit of padding all around which makes it very protective. We didn't use the clip included because he prefers to have it in his pocket so I don't know how the clip actually works.The only setbacks to this product is that he has to take the case out to charge it on his iphone dock we have because the case is too thick for this, but I'm sure that if you have different accessories it may not be an issue for you. Next setback is the fact that the edges on the front of the case make it a bit hard to reach the keys at the edge when typing.But I am willing to sacrifice a little bit (very little) of easiness in order to avoid accidents!I am definitely recommending this product!
