Strengths:This headset connects quickly to the phone, is easy to use, and reception is clear. I had a BT200 before this one. Other than the color difference, I asked what is so different? Upon making my first call with the headset, I immmediately noticed how the transfer of the call from my P900 to the BT250 was almost instantaneous. The reception and clarity of the headset is clear and the connection time is quick. The adjustment time for the user to get used to this device is minimal. Just remember to answer your call by hitting the headset power button quickly. The headset has plenty of charge time to last throughout the day.Weaknesses:One weakness is that you should not use it outside when wind is present. However, this fault is not due to the headset itself. Another weakeness is that the holder of the BT250 needs improvement. I kept the device in my pocket without losing it. Within two days of starting to use the holder with the belt clip, I almost lost the BT250. Fortunately, I was able to trace my steps to locate it outside my car. Use great caution and be aware of your BT250 if you use the holder on your belt. If you sit down, the holder can easily can easily push the BT250 loose from the holder.Summary:With this headset, you can say goodbye to wires forever. Once you have a truly wireless headset, you will not want to go back to wires. The BT250 quickly connects to the phone, is clear and static free, and is relatively simple to use. Other than the holder of this BT250, you will enjoy this headset.
