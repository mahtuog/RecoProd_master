I didn't look carefully at the picture - the extendable boom mic only extends an inch or so - this means it's not directly in front of the mouth and the result is that I had to speak too loudly to be heard. The audio for music worked as advertised, but the maximum volume was too low as sent through my Verizon XV 6800 Pocket PC Phone.I ended up returning the item and getting a Blue Parrot Trucker's Headset which has a true boom mic and audio volume sufficient to be heard in any conditions. It doesn't have the stereo music capability, but I'm very happy with it's functionality as a phone headset
