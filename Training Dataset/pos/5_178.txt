This little dandy was quite a suprize in ease of use and performance.Pros:Very light. It doesn't have a AAA battery, but a coin one. This makes it extremely light, so it does not become irritating to the ear over time. Controls are easy to use. Because it does not hook over the outside of the ear, you can actually forget you have it on. I can still hear outside noises with it on, so I can conentrate on driving. Reception is very clear. It's smaller size keeps you from looking like one of those 'Star Trek Borg' people I see so many of out there. This was one of the cheapest Bluetooth headsets out there so I was worried about real-world quality, but this out performs many headsets approaching $100+.Cons:That little pointy thing coming out of the top, I originally thought was an antenna. It isn't. It's a soft rubber flexible fitting for inside the ear, and the long part actually curves around the inside fold of the ear and allows the unit to stay in place in your ear without the need to have a hook around the outside of the ear. At first I was dissapointed, but once I figured out it's intent, I was amazed at the ingenuity of it. Now its the best unit I have seen. Buy it. It's worth it.
