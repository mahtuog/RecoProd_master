I bought the $15.00 1GB microSD card and installed it the first day.Plugged the USB I had for my camera into the phone after formatting the card and downloaded a bunch of songs onto the micro by just drag and drop with windows. Dropped them into the Motorola/shared/audio folder.The phone recognized them right away. I moved some to the phone after it was unplugged and then realized the entire song could be used as ring tones. So I deleted the ones on my phone downloaded MP3 converter and cut into my favorite 20 songs (being careful not to overwrite any.) I saved them into the same folder on the phone with RT in front and moved them from the card to the phone after it was unplugged from the computer. That worked great for ringtones.When I want to download a picture from the phone I just make a copy from the phone to the card then plug the phone into the computer to take it out of the motorola/shared/pictures folder.No need for phone tools...
