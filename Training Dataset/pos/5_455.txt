When my previous head phones were damaged, I immediately asked myself "I wonder if anyone has made bluetooth head phones?" I found Plantronics and was amazed by how well they worked and how great they sound. I was most impressed with the talking feature and how the head phones would pause my music when I get a call and automatically resume at the same spot when the call ended. WONDERFUL!!I 100% recommend this product!!!
