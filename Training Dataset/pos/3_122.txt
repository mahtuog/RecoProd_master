I was amazed when this phone arrived with a Hebrew instruction booklet and carried the marque of the Orange cellphone service in Israel. I found an English language version of the instructions online. All I wanted was a telephone, and that is what I got. It does not do anything as sophisticated as texting, let alone take pictures or hook up to the web. But that's all right. It works great as a cellphone. The sound is clear and the buttons are large enough to push without making mistakes. I signed up with T-mobile and use the five faves service with no problem, and with the quad phone I can go overseas and know I can get a local SIM card for temporary use as needed. I recommend this phone as a phone for those who want nothing more, but understand that that's what you're getting, and be prepared to look for English instructions elsewhere.
