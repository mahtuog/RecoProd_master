While it's true that Verizon cripples the Bluetooth functionality in this phone (in fact they do this in several phones) you can work around this pretty easily by using a robust phone mngmt. package like BitPim (bitpim.org) and transferring files via the USB port. I've had excellent battery life with my Verizon RAZR, unlike other reviewers of this phone.Verizon's crippling of the Bluetooth interface is maddening, as is the fact that the Motorola Phone Tools software won't allow image/sound file transfer via the USB port. Again, the solution is use BitPim. Obviously Verizon is trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of their subscribers by forcing them to pay for everything they can, but if you work around that, Verizon does have an excellent network - my call quality is very very good.
