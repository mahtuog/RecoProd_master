I have a large amount of music on my Voyager phone and I wanted to hear it in stereo. I tried a standard headset, but it didn't tell me when a call came in, and the wire was awkward. I bought this unit with some trepidation as I've had poor results with previous Bluetooth connections.This one is perfect. It paired on the first try. Sounds good, lets me know about an incoming call. The microphone part doesn't sound great according to people I tried it with but it worked well enough.
