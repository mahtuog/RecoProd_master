I've bought three of these now, the first dating back to nearly 2 years ago. They all continue to function perfectly. Originally I purchased this for my Razr V3, but since then have used it to charge a Krzr, and a few USB-powered smartphones.High quality construction (as far as cheap plastic chargers go), and significantly less than you'll be charged at a wireless carrier's store for an identical product.A+
