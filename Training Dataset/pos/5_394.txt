I have used the iPad since the initial launch and absolutely love it. My main gripe has been the need to constantly clean the screen. I initially bought one of the mini stylus to try out and have since ordered a couple more for co workers. The quality is very good and the plug that fits the headphone port is perfect.My only disclaimer is that I use it as a pointer. I'm not trying to do handwriting or drawing on the iPad. It may be fine for those applications but that's not my thing. Like the iPad it is a simple design that just works.
