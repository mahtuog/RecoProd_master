I got them for my bluetooth, because I don't like them hanging on my ear and jiggling around. This works great when I can get them in right. No instructions on the proper way to where them, so I am guessing. Sometimes I get them in perfect and there great - other times they frustrate me. I guess after getting experience with them I'll be able to pop them in with no problem.
