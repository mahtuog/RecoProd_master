Okay, this is the first and only bluetooth I bought/own - and I'm yes amazed at how small it is and how it's still able to be so clear. I use it for me ps3, not cell phone and it works great. The RED FLAG that I give on this piece, is that it hurts my ear - my ear gets sore after just a little while. I've cut the tail short, shorter and shorter, no help. Anyhow, I'm sure that's different for everyone as nobody has the same ear shape. All in all, besides a little red ear, I'm happy with it lol.-Govna-
