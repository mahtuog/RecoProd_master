Good: Quality of the piece - thick leather and soft inside -feels substantial and solid. Protection - I dropped the phoneon hard floor maybe two dozen times before the screen cracked.Horizontal position is unobtrusive and fits well with car seat belt.Mediocre: Convenience - getting the phone out maybe difficultwhen in a hurry, or if the case is not on your belt.Poor: The spring that holds the case on your belt is not steel,but rather plastic. Therefore you are going to drop your phonea lot. I once almost lost it - it dropped while I wasgetting out of my car in the parking lot.
