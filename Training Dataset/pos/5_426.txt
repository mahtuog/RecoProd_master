A great product, bought it a month back here for a bargain. The headset paired up without any issues with my Samsung T509 phone, and the Dell Latitude D620 laptop. Crystal clear sound for both the parties. Talking over the phone in stereo is amazing, Works really well with Skype and Gtalk.The analog adapter is just amazing. With the analog adapter, music is amazing, the speakers have deep bass, crystal clear music. Without the adapter however, it won't work as my PC headphone, it pairs up but nothing is audible.If I had it on for over an hour it starts hurting my ears, the over the head design could be a bit slimmer and/or softer, it hurts my hairless head :o) As someone else mentioned, that blinking light makes it a pain to use in any public place. I used a black marker and painted over the light - not much help there :p
