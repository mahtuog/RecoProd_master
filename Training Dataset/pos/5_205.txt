I was looking at this case for a long time and now I have it in my hands. It is pretty much what I wanted for a Palm case to be. It is sturdy, has nice padding and fits my Palm just perfect. It might feel slippery a bit as someone admitted before but I don't find it that much. And yes, SD card holder is very handy. Belt clip is bit bulky but serves its purpose when you need it. Otherwise just disconnect it. So in short it is just what I wanted.
