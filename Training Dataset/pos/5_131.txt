Interesting shape and blue light that glows when this unit is plugged into the cigarette lighter. Can't believe that I've paid 5x as much for off brand car chargers in the past. Some have come apart, some have stopped working after shorting out. This Motorola charger feels like a quality piece and appears to be one that will last. Have no idea why anyone would buy an off brand when you can have legendary Motorola quality with a cool looking shape/light. Can't think of one thing that would improve this charger. The price is the best part!! Highly recommend!
