I got this for my dad and saw him open it and use it for the first time. It's been a few weeks since Christmas and it hasn't broken or anything. It was a bit of a snug fit but the next size up would have been too big. My dad said his old one was fake leather and looked nice but started to fade and fall apart in a short period of time. This one seems more durable.
