This is a very nice looking case. The PDA fits snugly and doesnt slide around. The latch on my case seems very secure and takes some effort to open. As far as the button style swivel belt clip, I have never seen one that works well and Ive had them on various phones and pda cases. I dont rely on them.The main thing I dislike about this case is that it opens to the left, not the right like other cases Im used to. A minor thing that I can get used to.
