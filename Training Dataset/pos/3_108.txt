Purchased this as my fingers are pretty large. Works ok but keep in mind it is small. I have a small lowepro camera case that holds my ipod tuch 4 and its Belkin grip edge case quite handy for active transport and protection with belt velcro loop attatchment (very secure). If I slide my ipod into the case with the stylus connected to the earjack port it fits in no problem. You CANNOT reach the entire ipod screen when this is connected to the earjack. You get most of it but for the area near the top you need to pull it out from the jack port. Somewhat of a hassle.
