I recently purchased a Jawbone bluetooth headset. Works great. Ear fit was a little loose and I found myself pushing it more into my ear to hear better. Having seen the suggestions and other reviews to use the Jabra Clear Ear Gels, I decided to try some. Got them yesterday and couldn't get them to fit. Read some more reviews this morning and saw that you have to play with them a bit. So I did. I found out that the set I got had a few different sizes BUT all of them except 1 were formed for use in the right hand ear! I have poor hearing in my right ear so usually use my left for phone conversations. I was able to use the one for the left ear and get it to fit pretty well. I don't know if it is the best fit cause I couldn't compare any other size. I did remove the 1/4-turn ear piece that came with the Jawbone and stuck the Jabra directly onto the stem. After removing the ear loop, it seems that the modified Jawbone will stay in my ear and I can remove it a certain way so that it doesn't slip off. If I use the earloop, the Jabra ear gel slips off when taking it off my ear. Is comfortable but I haven't used it for a long time yet.
