This is my 5th phone and compared to the other phone that i had to keep replacing, this phone is great. the one i had before this phone was a sony ericcson t62u and it kept on stopping working so after i had 4 of them in 6 months i got fed up and decided i would go buy a new phone. so i liked this one. and everything works great on it, the battery life is great, the way the menu and the ease of use is great. and i love how the ringtones are real songs not just beeps. the only thing i don't like is like one guy said up there, my screen is a little squeky when i open it, but i dont really care. i recommend this phone to anyone
