The headset is light and fits the ear perfectly. Unfortunately, often people have a hard time hearing me. I can hear them perfectly. I am most impressed with its durability. I forgot it in a pants pocket. The pants went through a wash and dryer. The headset still works albeit with the same problems I mentioned above.
