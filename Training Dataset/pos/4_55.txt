Like many others, I purchased the Jabra EarGels because I couldn't get myJawbone 2to stay securely in my ear. No mater which size earloop I tried, the Jawbone would flap against the side of my face as I walked. As a result, the 'noise assassin' sensor wouldn't touch my face, mitigating the benefit it should have had.Pros:+Jawbone now fits securely in my ear, even without the ear loop+Incredibly comfortable+Sound seems 'clearer' now that the speaker fits snugger in my ear and the noise assassin sensor touches my face.Cons:+The silicon isn't perfectly clear, and the yellowish tinge makes them look dirty+Much larger than I thought they would be - they're quite conspicuous.
