My Blackberry charger port is broken and that part amazingly is not under warranty. My options are to buy another phone for $449.00, buy one on Ebay for $130.00, or buy an external charger and spare battery. This choice for less than $20.00 works super. Each night I take the days battery out and replace with the extra. It works great.
