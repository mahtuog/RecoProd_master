With the exception of the (annoying) flashing blue light on the outside of the right ear piece, this bluetooth headset outperforms others I have tried. As with most bluetooth devices, it is subject to momentary signal loss of (3 sec) durations. The sound quality is good when compared with my hard wired Bose QC3 set (w/o noise compensation consideration). Channel separation and the ability to adjust my iphone sound levels externally were a pleasant surprise (music selection advance/replay feature did not work with my iphone). The Amazon price compared to others made this quite satisfactory decision a "know" brainer!!
