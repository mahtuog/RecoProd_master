Everyone in my family has Motorolas (V400, V220, T720) so I was used to those and was skeptical about getting an LG. glad I did! The screen is better than my sisters V400 (it says 128x160 pixles, but looks FAR better) the keys and phone have a good, sturdy feel. The camera is awesome for a camera phone, it looks like a 2 or 3 MP camera!!!! (no, seriously) although there are 3 keys that have to do with the camera...they're not intrusive, but i think its a little overkill. While closed, you can light up the screen, see time OR date, and flip between vibrate and normal sound. VERY conveinient. The screen is bright (inside and out) the sound of ringtones and while talking is awesome. When you turn the ringing volume up its EXTREMELY LOUD, so you never have to wish it were louder. Signal is great. The included ringtones and wallpapers arent the best (there are only 4 wallpapers) but you can get some others online. all in all, GREAT phone!!!
