At first glance I fell in love with the phone - the small design, the chrome plated front, all my friends just love it, thinking its another high-priced, fancy phone from nokia/cingular, when surprisingly it was very affordable, but I must admit - it IS fancy, yet extremely "phone newbie" friendly.It has everything you want and need plus more. It has text messaging, multimedia messaging, polyphonic ringtones, MEDIA NET, to download many more ringtones, games, applications, ANYTHING else you may want or need for your nokia 3120, can be found on media net. It's the internet on your phone, letting you download practically anything you may want, including java apps. If youre at work, the movies, or dont feel like calling anyone, you can go ahead and use your instant message feature, by logging onto AIM or YAHOO to chat with your buddies. There are many more features to this phone - like any screensaver you could want, you can even record your own voice or music to use as a ringtone.Popular? 300 contacts/Calendar with 500 entries.Cant get up in the morning? Alarm clock.Timing something? Stopwatch/countdown.Bilingual? English, French, Spanish, Portuguese languages supported.You can talk for 6 hours if you like on this phone, or you can go ahead and leave it on your desk for over 16 DAYS, yes DAYS, and still be able to talk. Total standby time is 17 days.The call quality is great, except if you put the the phone too close to a stereo or your speakers, it makes the speakers beep, which is the only downside, but is totally negligable.I'd give this phone 4/5 stars, because of all the features you can have on a phone that's 4.01 inches long x 1.68 inches wide x 0.76 inch thick, and weighs just about 3 ounces.
