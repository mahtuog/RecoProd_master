Amazon dosen't carry a picture of this case on their website but search for nokia ctu-24 in google to see the picture at other websites, I knew what I was getting, hence I am not dissapointed . Why 4 stars you say? There should have been an opening to charge the 3650 while in this case, there isin't...what was nokia thinking?...but other than this the case is well made and the inner lining of the case is soft so no scratches on the phone's LCD. Of course like the other reviewers have said - you can't make or receive calls when the phone is in this case. Well the other cases cost 25+shipping and this one's 12.99...so it's a compromise..
