Batteries for the e815, 710, etc. leave something to be desired. It's a good deal for the price, but I still don't get as much life as I expected out of this "extended" battery. I've bought three of these, and will probably buy a fourth and fifth, simply because they are so cheap. They do need a way to charge these without being in the phone. All in all, a good deal for the money.
