A couple of years ago I ordered the Pulsar Plantronics 590E set from another website and while their product description indicated I would recieve all of the accessories (the same info was used for the 590A) I didn't get them. Even without those accessories these headphones have been the best bluetooth wireless investment I've made so far. The sound quality is excellent and the controls are easy to learn. Pairing with various bluetooth enabled devices has been a breeze. The additional accessories the the 590A comes with just added icing to the cake. I'd reccomend these wireless headphones to anyone. As a matter if fact I bought this set for my fiancee to use with her Samsung Rumor and her iPod Nano and she loves them.
