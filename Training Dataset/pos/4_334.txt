---Pros and Cons:P: popular model, so accessories are plentifulC: popular model, so you're not uniqueP: VZ Navigator (VZN) for $10/mo is very useful... Voice navigation with street names being read aloud is nice.C: It uses minutes to re-calculate routes, so it's not unlimited usageP: VZN doesn't need the $15/mo VCastC: ..which is nice if you don't use VCast, but the point is that there's no way to get unlimited VZN use.P: Speakerphone is loudC: ..but not loud enough when drivingP: Voice prompt person/phone number lookup is greatC: ..but sometimes still requires pushing a button, making it not truly hands-freeP: mp3/mpeg4/jpg playback is neat; convert video to 3GP using a tool called "SUPER" - www.erightsoft.comC: controls are clunky, screen resolution small, no full-screen supportP: expandable memory for 1GB of mp3/mpeg4/jpgC: you need to remove the battery cover and battery to gain access to itP: lightweight, slim metal housingC: easily scratched; I bought a $25 skin at shildzone.comP: easily readable display, keysC: 176 x 220 resolution and 65k color depth is pretty lowP: Verizon interface is faster than the Moto interfaceC: verizon interface... yuck, yuck, yuckP: V3m supports BT Dial-Up-Networking (DUN) profile so you can use your phone as a high-speed modemC: While it does work, if you plan on doing more than just testing it out, the Terms of Service require you purchase a data plan for ~$50/mo. It's a shame they don't have flexible day/week plans for the occasional traveler.---Cons with hackable resolutions:C: Vibrate + Ring is disabledC: BT OBEX is disabledC: Motorola Phone Tools Multimedia button disabledC: self-imported mp3 ringtones are disabled= all have unofficial work-arounds; see mark.cdmaforums.com---Cons with no resolutions:C: BREW instead of Java - which means a very limited number of games and appsC: I have average-sized hands, and find the 4-way button and the middle button to be difficult to press.C: Signal at my house, in the middle of a metropolis, is 0-1 barsC: one day of standby + 5-6 calls + 15-minute VZN usage = 50% battery. Woah, go CDMA...C: the 1.3MPixel camera takes worse photos than my VGA camera from 1997 - I'm not kidding.C: the video camera is absolutely pointlessC: As much as I enjoy VZN, it loses signal once in while, which left me in some uncomfortable situations.C: With a subpar web browser and non-live TV clips, I found VCast to be absolutely pointless. Sprint's live TV feed definitely adds more value.C: CDMA, so this phone won't work overseas.---Conclusion:All in all, a decent phone that's great for someone looking for a slim CDMA phone with expandable memory, mp3/mpeg4 playback, and Navigation. As a previous GSM customer, the Verizon lockdown of the phone is just mind-boggling, but at least they can be disabled with some work. If I wasn't being forced to go Verizon, I'd still go GSM. Good luck!
