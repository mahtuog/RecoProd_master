All I can say is...wow!I have been waiting for the longest time for a binural (two speaker) wireless headset that actually worked well and didn't have a bulky battery pack.This headset went far and above my expectations. So enough about the praise, here's the nitty gritty.Ordered my unit from Amazon, received it within 5 days.Setup the headset with my Motorola Razr, worked like a charm, but this isn't why I bought it. I bought it to be used with my computer, as I develop web based audio/video conferencing solutions. So I tried using the headset with my Bluetooth 1.2 Adapter (cheapy from Walmart) - It took a little bit of setup (had to upgrade the bluetooth stack on windows xp, then pair the headset with the computer. I got it to work, but the audio didn't sound very good. It sounded a lot like a record.Seeing as how the headset is Bluetooth 2.0 I decided to purchase a bluetooth 2.0 adapter. Found a kingston unit at BestBuy for $40.00, installed this unit. (This time setup was easier as the kingston install removed the old bluetooth software and installed the new) - This time the audio was incredible, CD quality.Microphone is very sensitive, was able to pick up a co-worker's voice 10 feet away crystal clear.Over-all I highly recommend this unit - a little pricey, but worth every penny!
