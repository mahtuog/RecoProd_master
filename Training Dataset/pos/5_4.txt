I've gone through many different bluetooth headphones. This is the first pair I ever bought many many years ago. I'm wearing them right now. I've tried the S9's, S10's, Jabra Halo, Jabra Sport, Arctic Cooling. That doesn't even include the plain old jerk-buds.These look atrocious. My wife hates them. They are still my gold standard.I have a walk that kills BT reception every time on every headset. These only lose the signal for half a step. The Jabra Sport, by contrast, doesn't even work when it is set on the table in front of me. The Arctic Cooling headphones are my latest. They are more comfortable, but still lose the signal whenever I walk outside.Yes, I live next to a Cell Tower. So my situation is very stressful for a BT headphone or headset. The BT820s, old school, just work. Period.
