Once again Nokia had their end user in mind when they designed a simple, useful and durable product in their mobile phone holder. I used it for over a year before I sold my car with the phone holder installed in it. I hope the new owner is using a Nokia phone, because I miss it. I have purchased a complete car kit and will install it in my new car this weekend, but in the meantime while I am fumbling with my phone in the car, (of course I'm using a headset), I realize how great the holder was. (...) There is nothing to think about except: where are you going to install it? Consistent with the sharp design and great support of their products, the low priced, functional mobile phone holder is another winner for Nokia.
