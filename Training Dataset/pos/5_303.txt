I don't like the plastic belt clip but the clear cover is all I wanted anyway. By the way, you can take the plastic knob off. You just need a really small screw driver (like the kind you use to fix your glasses). The first day I put it on my Pearl, I dropped it. Not even a scratch on the cover. And for an unexpected bonus, the indicator light reflects off the clear plastic to make it easier to see if I have any messages or alerts.
