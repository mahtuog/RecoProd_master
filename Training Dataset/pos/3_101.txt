I've had my 250 for about three months now. While I realize this hardly makes me an expert or a Bluetooth elite, I am not that enthused with this headset.In the first place, the general feeling I get when handling it, is that it is of marginal construction and "quality" was, perhaps, sacrificed to get a unit out on the market.While I will say that it is very comfortable to wear, it fails in one major area - that of "user" volume. I am forever being told that I cannot be heard or that my audio is so low as to be almost a whisper. I didn't buy a headset so I could stand in the corner and yell into my phone; I've seen enough of these "ego heads" doing that in airports and restaurants; talking so loud as though everyone should be interested in their conversation.So I am actively looking again. Maybe the thing to do is just to wait it out and see if SOMEONE can't come up with a headset that is comfortable to wear that actually performs as it says it will.
