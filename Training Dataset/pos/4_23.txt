These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping.The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying.
