This is a GREAT holster for your Palm or Blackberry product. I use it every day, all day for my Treo 650. Going horizontal is SO much better....and the magnetic clip is easy to use and secure.The original Treo 650 case could be swiveled to horizontal but was difficult to open quickly. The leather also looks much nicer in an executive environment. The price was fair and the delivery was quick.If you carry your palm all the time like I do....in and out of cars......at work and at home.....this is a GREAT case!
