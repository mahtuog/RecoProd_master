I have had NO problems hearing or being heard with the Bluespoon. I love that it is so small and not very noticable. I also wear glasses quite a bit so I like that it doesn't go over the outside of the ear like a lot of them do. But probably the best thing about this little gadget was the price! $20 after rebate! can't beat that anywhere. If you have trouble with the rubber piece (that looks like an antena) that holds in your ear, just be patient and adjust it different angles until it's comfortable. I'm so used to it now, I hardly notice it and it doesn't bother me at all. Everyone that sees mine wants one!
