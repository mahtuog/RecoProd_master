I have tried three other handsfree kits for the 8500 and none of them worked very well. I hesitated at first because of the price, but I later decided that I desevered to have reliability and good sound quality. The kit does require some hard wiring, but I was able get everything going in less than an hour. Passengers will have to speak loudly to be heard, but it works great for driving alone.
