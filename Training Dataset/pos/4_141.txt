This is a decent phone ive had it about a year now this is my first phone and i am 16. Its somewhat stylish i guess ive seen a couple people with it is a very good basic call phone and texting. other features include internet which is expensive and kinda worthless. The only thing i can complain about is about 9 onths in i was at my computer doing some school work i placed it near the speaker and a friend called it made a reall loud staticy noise (my speakers were up pretty loud so that could of contributed to it)it was actually starteling and made me jump up and turn off the computer. about a weak later i put it on my tv entering my room layed down and another friend called and it did it again not as loud but still pretty annoying. Anyway its not like the world will end but you might get startled once in awhile.
