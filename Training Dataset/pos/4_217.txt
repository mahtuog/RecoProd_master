I've actually got the BT200 but thought i'd leave my thoughts here anyway. I've been using this for about 18months now and have generally had no problems. I think bluetooth handsfree kits in general are worth the money over the wired ones as they give you true hands free that works (doesn't fall out of your ear when you turn your head while driving). The Jabra in particular is far better design than any others on the market at the moment because by design its more likely to fit different ear and head shapes. Also the in-ear design means you have the best chance of hearing the other party clearly. And I have never not been able to hear the other person. Setup is easy and takes about 2min. Day to day operation is simple, you just turn it on and it works.There are 2 reasons why I have only give this a 4 star rating.1) Some time it doesn't connect with my T68i after having been out of range (but to be fair I think this is more the crappy T68i than the Jabra)2) When outdoors it isn't very good at cutting out background noise so the person on the other end can't hear me verywell (NOTE: this is ONLY when i'm outdoors. Indoors or in a car while moving is perfect)One of my mates has one too so I know what its like being on the receiving end of a conversation and its fine.
