Even though the price is right, the color is not what i expected. The color is more of a burgandy not Red. However, its a very nice color and has the motorola sign on it. Comes nicely packaged in a reclosable container that can store the stock case. Amazon packes it in with air filled pouches. ALL IN ALL I GIVE IT A 5 star. However, becasue of the wrong color, it goes down to a 4 star.
