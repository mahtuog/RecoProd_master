This is my second Bluespoon AX2. The first suffered from a problem I later learned as common to the AX2 - refusal of the unit to charge after several weeks use. The AX2 is sensitive to the length of charge and will ultimately refuse to charge at all if it is not fullt run down to a zero charge and then fully charging it. It appears to also have a delicate power connector. If the supplied power charging connector is pushed all the way (without forcing) it can damage the AX2.The AX2 needs to be managed nd treated more carefully than a consumer device should require (beyond reasonable care).My new unit is starting to show signs of chrging problems (as my firt one did. Unfortunately the warranty is only 2 weeks - the shortest warranty period I have ever heard of.
