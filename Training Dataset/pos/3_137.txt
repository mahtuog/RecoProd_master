I have had this holster for a little over a month to hold my blackberry pearl. It securely holds my phone and protects it well. The clip is more handy than I had anticipated and swivel to different degrees which is useful. It seems to be well made but the little blackberry emblem has already fallen off which makes the case look kinda ghetto. Overall, a pretty good case for the price but plan on having that small repair.
