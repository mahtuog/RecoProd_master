excellent fit, has the magnet built-in to trigger standby mode - sturdy belt clip that rotates. I wish the belt clip would be higher up on it cause i hate the phone digging into my side when i sit down, but i just wear it on my pocket instead of my belt - it's really a matter of personal preference, and as far as these things go, this one is very well made and works great.
