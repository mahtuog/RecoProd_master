The Jabra I love it alot. Hard to fell of when it on your ear. Some other band when you bow or jump etc... it fell out. Battery, long too. Since my bluetooth run out battery in short; however, my still underwarranty so I call they replace it for me. Still wait for they send me the on replace, but I have to send my to them first.
