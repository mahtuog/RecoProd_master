I have been using this device for two months, and have been generally happy with it - the audio fidelity is good, the unit is comfortable, the battery life is long and, although I haven't tested the maximum range, I usually use it at 10 to 12 feet from the phone (Nokia 6820). My house is in a marginal reception area for Cingular, and using the headset allows me to put the phone in a "sweet spot" with an unusual orientation, giving me three or four bars instead of one.The "belt clip" is a joke.
