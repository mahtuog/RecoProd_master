THESE ARE EXCELLENT COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS EARGEL DEVICES THAT WERE AVAILABLE. IF YOU HAVE DIFFICULY GETTING THEM TO STAY IN YOUR EAR, IT TAKES A LITTLE PRACTICE TO GET USED TO THEM, BUT THE TROUBLE IS WORTH IT DUE TO THE QUALITY OF SOUND YOU GET WITH THESE GEL EAR PIECES.GREAT PRICE, AND THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE DIFFICULTY TRYING TO GET THESE IN MY EAR TO GET USED TO THEM.THANKS AMAZON
