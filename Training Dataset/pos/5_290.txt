The Andrew Extensis has been a great addition to my home. I run all the phones in my house through the Extensis and have saved $20/month (relative to having both cell and landline service) through using this device. It's reliable and allows me to have extension phones throughout the house rather than carrying a cellphone from room to room. Given the fact that increasing numbers of folks are using cellphones as their principal telephone (see New York Times of August 2003) it's surprising that this item has been discontinued and nobody else seems to have picked up on the concept.
