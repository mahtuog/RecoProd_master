the best thing about this is the price. But I agree with the reviewer that says the jagged knob in the back is a pain to deal with. But if you take a look at the photos, it doesn't show the knob - which gives the impression that it is removable. if it is, it's not evident. I tried to break it off as I don't use the belt clip anyway but it started to crack the rest of the plastic. oh well...you get what you pay for.
