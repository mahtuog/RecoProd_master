If you own a phone with bluetooth then you need one of these headsets. I waited a while before ordering the item for the price to come down and it did to a reasonable amount here at Amazon.com. The unit works great. I was surprised by the clarity and reception. My only complaint is with Jabra. It would be nice to have some sort of battery meter on the unit. That way you know when to recharge. For those interested I am using it with a Sony 610.
