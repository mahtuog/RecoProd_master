Well I was skeptical as hell about buying from a company I've never heard of, for a product that was 1/5th the cost of what I felt was reasonable. I was completely wrong. In spite of being shipped USPS, it showed up the first day of the delivery window. I plugged it in and snapped on the cover (which actually seems marginally sturdier than the original), charged it... And didn't charge it again for a week. *FLAWLESS*. Dirt cheap bargain basement price, and my talk time went from 20 min (with a bluetooth headset) to over 3 hours... This is a massive amount of bang for the buck. No complaints and I'd make the same purchase in a heartbeat.
