Ounce for ounce - about a fourth of the cost of Gold.But its way2kool and works well. Star Trek like - with a bright flashing blue light behind your ear.I can hear others loud and clear.Others can hear me loud and clear - even if I talk softly (the mike is near your earlobe).Therefore - meets the base requirements. Now for other things -Its easy to lose - since it is so small.It hides behind your ears and almost disappears from view - others may think you are mad and talking to thin air.Batteries "may" be non-replaceable. No mention of this, but I have figured out how the device can be opened (there is one tiny screw) and will come to it when the batteries do die. Batteries seem to last many hours - I haven't tested exactly how long.No warning before batteries die. You can be cut off in the middle of a conversation. Some warning beeps would have been nice.I've paired it in the "enhanced" mode with the sony t610 - works just fine if you bother to read the manual and undertake enhanced pairing. You will get problems others mention if you do regular pairing. There are some glitches but those are on the phone side (I can't hear the beep before I voice dial if I am using the headset). Voice dialling does not work in a noisy environment - but that is not the headsets fault. It works well otherwise. Nothing to complain - all features mentioned work and do so well.The Sony T610 phone has very limited range with this headset. However, this is a phone issue. I also use this with a Linksys USBBT100 adapter and have absolutely no range problems - signal goes through to the furthest corner of all rooms (see my Linksys USBBT100 review).If only it would "beam me up" star trek style.
