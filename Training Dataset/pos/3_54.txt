The headset seems to pick up the user's speech fairly well. However, a steady &quot;clicking&quot; sound will sometimes arise which both the user and the person on the other end can hear. I tried to adjust the connection between the headset and the phone, but the noise persisted. It doesn't happen all the time, but does happen fairly often.Another feature that would have been nice but was not included is a button on the wire (as with wireless headsets for other phones) that allows the user to answer and hang up without having to deal with the phone itself.Overall, seems to be the best product available for the Nextel Iden series, but is not a great product.
