These stereo headphones have extremely good quality sound. They are very comfortable to wear and I have worn them for up to four hours. They are extremely easy to use and connect to my LG 9400 phone. The hard case to carry them and other equipment is excellent. The item that makes this the best value by far in a stereo bluetooth headset is the analog adapter. I use this to listen to music when I am using the computer and also to listen to my ipod shuffle. I can put the analog adapter in my pocket and clip the metal shuffle on my pocket and it works pefectly. Because of the adapter, this would be the only stereo headset that I would consider buying. The only negative that I have is the flashing light on the headset. It is a little distracting, but is a minor inconvenience. I strongly recommend this product!!!
