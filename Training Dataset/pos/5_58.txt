Didn't like the earloop that comes std with the BlueAnt bluetooth headset so I purchased a package of the eargels. My earpiece now comfortably fits in my ear and I can hear the call much better. It took a couple of tries to figure out which was the right size to use, so I was thankful for the variety. It takes a couple of days to get used to (feeling was slightly annoying at first) but the trade offs are totally worth it and my ear got used to it in no time.
