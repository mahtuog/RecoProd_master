This is a fabulous device. It is wonderful when it works properly, and it is frustrating when it does not. I have used this product for almost a year now. It comes with 2 of the rubber pieces. I have now lost both of the pieces. a 2 foot drop to the wood floor caused an inner piece of the speaker to fall off.The device comes with a neckband so you can hang onto it, except while wearing it thus, the rubber piece quite often falls off. I have picked up this little piece of rubber that is supposed to go into my ear, off of numerous places. Once it falls if you are not somewhere with some cleanser, you really don't want to put it back -into- your ear again.It is a great device, but wonderfully frustrating as well. It is extremely light, makes for a lot of cool comments, and is a pleasure to use. I had no problem pairing it with 4 different phones and my laptop. It sounds good in the wind, and doesn't give a headache when you wear it for long periods of time. I could put it on in the a.m. and forget it's even there all day. Volume lower button has redial, so you end up having to raise volume after redialing.It takes some getting used to in order to put it into your ear. I suggest putting middle finger on top corner of the USB input, index on the rubber tip, and thumb on the mike end. I would recommend getting a pouch or holster to keep it safe when not in use.Would I buy it again? ProbablyWould I recommend it to others? If you want something cool and interesting, this is it.
