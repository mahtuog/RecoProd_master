I like everything wireless, and these headphones are awesome!I was able to pair them with my phone, it's an LG vx8600 with the mp3 player. The headphones sound great, and I can even change tracks, and adjust volume with the buttons on the headphone.When a call comes in, I hear it through the headphones, and press a button to answer. Everyone I talk to says the voice quality sounds really good on their end, after the call is over, the music resumes. You can also voice dial, so you really don't have to take your phone out of your pocket.I also paired them with my computer, I used a bluetooth program called BlueSoleil, and a generic dongle. It took me a while to figure out that I had to go into the sound menu on my computer, and set the bluetooth device as the default sound input. Once I got it working, it sounds even better than with my phone. Itunes sounds really good, because you can use the equalizer to tweak the sound to your liking.The batteries last a long time, I've been using these a lot since I got them a few days ago, and haven't had to charge them yet.When playing games, and watching video, there is a little lag between, the picture and sound, but it doesn't bother me much.The little transmitter works great too. I plugged it into my computer sound port, before I got the bluesoleil working, and it paired right up, and sounds good.Bottom line, so far, I don't have any thing but praise for these headphones!
