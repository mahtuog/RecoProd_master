The Pulsar 590A is without a doubt the finest BlueTooth device I have ever used. The 11 hour battery life is unmatched, and the versatility of telephone or audio headset, wired or wireless operation is similarly unparalleled. It looks elegant in its charging stand and the "hockey puck" analog adapter that turns any headphone jack into a stereo Bluetooth transmitter is worth its weight in Platinum.The only problem is the $245 MSRP price tag. Fortunately I acquired mine for $110 through Amazon, and at that price it is a bargain impossible to turn down. Plantronics is the headset company that equipped the Apollo astronauts and Mission Control, and they make industrial strength equipment. They also were the vendor of choice for the old Bell System; if you've talked with a Telephone Operator, they probably were using a Plantronics headset.If you can find it at a reasonable discount, as I did, BUY IT. You will not regret the purchase.
