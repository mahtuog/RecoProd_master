This case is full-grain leather with black elastic sides.It was too snug when I first opened it, but afterI stuffed it with a sweatsock and let it sit for a day,it was fine. The catch does not open accidentallyand the belt clip is very well made and seems very sturdy indeed.This case gives your Kick a rather serious/professional look.It's far more attractive than the workaday case that ships with the Sidekick. So this should be on your list if you are casting about for a pleasing replacement for the original case.
