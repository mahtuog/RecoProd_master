This charger works great on my Motorola RAZR V3M, but I'd just like to point out that this is NOT as pictured. The M on the front of the cigarette lighter jack does not light up blue, but rather there is a blue LED beneath the M. This is obviously, as another reviewer stated, a knock off of the original. I'd purchase this again however, as it's $3 instead of the $8 for the one with the light-up M.
