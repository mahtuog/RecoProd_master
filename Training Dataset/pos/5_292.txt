I have not had one single problem with this phone. I can hear people clearly when I make outbound calls and recieve inbound calls. Loaded with features. Reliable phone. I have always had Samsung phones and have had nothing but problems with them. (Samsung N625, X427)LG is a great manufacture, and this is one of their first GSM phones (they mostly make CDMA phones for Verizon Wireless). It is a tri-band world phone, has a large external caller-id, large screen and vibrant 65k color display, great quality camera with photo caller ID. Also, polyphonic music tones sound great on this phone and surfing the web is easy!My only complaint is the bulky appearance but I have started to get use to it. Overall, a great buy. I would reccommend this phone over any other Samsung phone that Cingular currently offers. However, if you are looking for speakerphone and bluetooth technology, go for the Motorola V600. I find LG's programming interface easier to use than Motorola's. It's a bit trickier with the Motorola V400 and V600 to navigate your menu options.
