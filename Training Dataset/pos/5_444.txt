This A2DP bluetooth headphone is excellent. When listening to music I hear instruments that I don't hear on my home or car system and this headphone has awed every friend or co-worker that has tried it on and listened to it. It is very functional (provided you are right handed) with almost any accessory that you need already included including a hard case to carry it all in and a dongle to use with any headphone out jack. Sound is awesome whether it comes from my phone, PC, or TV. Another plus is that Plantronics seems to be using a common charge port for their different bluetooth products. You have the ability to charge this using AC or via USB with both charger cords included. The phone functions are great too. People I have talked to on this headphone say it sounds nearly as good as speaking right into the phone. It also comes with a charging stand to use at home or work. You won't be disappointed unless you hate the style and color. I've used Plantronics headsets in the television industry since the 70's and based on past experience knew I was buying a quality product.
