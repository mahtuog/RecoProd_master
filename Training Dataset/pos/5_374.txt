I am not one of those early adopter kinds so really wait for the technolody to mature before getting a product.. I didn't have to wait too long for a great wireless bluetooth headset. I have no complaints.. Using it for about 3 months.. Worth every penny.. The only problem is that this is so well disguised that people around me sometimes look at me oddly or think i am speaking to them.. Recommend greatly..
