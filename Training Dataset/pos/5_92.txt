turned out good. took a little bit to get used to it but works fine no loop anymore required which is good considering I broke all the other ones I had. Oh and once you get them (they come in a package of three for three different ear sizes, small, medium and large) you can super glue it on to your jawbone for a little more stability because for the jawbone the eargel can be a little loose. oh and its much louder then the stock ear adapter deal that comes with the jawbone. for me it was too loud with my krazer cell phone. I had the volume setting for as low as it would go and it was still blasting my ear drum. I ended up wodding up a piece of paper and sticking in there to baffle the volume. works near perfect now..
