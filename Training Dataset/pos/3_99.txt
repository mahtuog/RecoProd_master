I bought this for my wife a while ago and pairs with her samsung slider phone (can't remember the model number off of the top of my head) quite easily. I've had occassion to use it myself (when I have to use her phone) so I feel that I can confidently rate it.Overall, it isn't too bad for a handsfree. There are times when I call her (even on a land line) and it sounds like she's digitally stuttering. In my opinion; not good. It's realatively light weight and you can wear it for a long period of time without alot of discomfort (she does wear it quite often during the day). The different ear pieces give you the ability to give a custom fit feel to it, which is nice. I've read in some of the other reviews for the bt250v (a similar model) that it has a tendency to fall off if you move your head too quickly; I can see why.Truth be told, I almost purchased one of these for my own cell phone use (I own a Motorola v360) but I read the reviews for the Plantronics Voyager PLT 510. :) I'm glad I did - but that's another review.
