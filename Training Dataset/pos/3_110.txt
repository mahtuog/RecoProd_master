*This product is very small, I expected a bit larger. Total height is less than half the height of my Galaxy Nexus.*Very lightweight. Some added weight in the bottom of the unit would add stabilization.*There is no grip on bottom, which causes it to slide just about every time you interact with it.*The opening for bottom of phone is very slim, SamsungGN with (standard verizon holster) back shell just barely fits. Consider the thickness of your device before buying. This is really a universal stand, so making it fit perfectly is impossible--but realize that not every phone will fit securely.*Where the back of the phone rests is very nice--with a soft felt-like protective material.*The bamboo has some type of laminate which makes it smooth to the touch. I was hoping for more of a raw feeling as the smoothness makes it feel "mass produced".
