Pros:-great sound in BT mode. It's actually not perfect, but you won't notice after a minute.-can connect like a regular headphone, without power, using included cable. Sound is even better than wireless.-full charge lasts a long time.-sound delay is not as bad as it seems. I velcro'd my puck to the back of a PSP and it works fine.-With some effort, you can safely pop off the foam ear pads and wash them.-Can pair with multiple devices.-stops audio if a call comes in.-comes with a USB power connector, so you don't have to carry the brick.Cons:-tight fit, but it's ok if you stretch it a few times and don't use the charging base.-the prorietary Plantronics power adapter is GARBAGE. I'm about to solder in a USB connector because their design is so flaky.-early units would occasionally fry and not charge (despite being spec'd for worldwide use). Props to Plantronics for replacing them for free.-volume controls are left/right; track controls are up/down. How does that make sense?Note:If you are new to BT profiles, you'll have to get used to the fact that there are two "profiles" in use for these devices: Headset and A/V. Headset is for phone calls, uses the mic, and is phone quality audio. A/V is for high-quality audio and does not use the mic. They are mutually exclusive profiles. This is complicated by the fact that most software implementation is hardly intuitive, so setting up can be confusing.Be sure to turn off the BT of other devices you have paired with (phone, puck, computer) when connecting with one particular device, otherwise your audio will be a wreck.
