I was looking for a durable phone that could take a blow or pressure and keep working. I also did not want random pieces of it falling off when it was struck. I'm a fairly small individual and I also needed a phone that had to be small enough to fit into my pocket comfortably with no protrusions to gouge me. I did not need a camera or any extraneous features like that. This phone seems to be fitting these criteria perfectly. I was planning on spending quite a bit on a phone to meet those criteria, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this phone was free on my plan.I have dropped it a couple of times from about 10-12 feet up onto concrete and it keeps working just fine. It has slid for about 20 feet across a piece of concrete. It does have some minor scuffs after this but nothing significant. It does not have any buttons on the sides so there is nothing there to have fallen off when it hit the concrete. It has been submersed in a water tank and seems to have come back from it well also.As far as visibility of the display issues that other people have mentioned in their reviews, I have noticed that it has what seems to be a "power save" type situation it kicks into where the display is difficult to read. Hitting certain keys seems to kick this "mode" off. Other than those situations I have had no more difficulty reading the display than on other candy bar style phones I have had from Nokia. I have used it in direct sunlight and in various other lighting situations.
