this headset kicks! i dont even want to call it a 'headset', cuz it's waay too small for that.it's available online for about 20 US bucks, and it's worth 10 times that, easily.after using a Jabra BT200 with my newy aquired motorola L2, i wanted something smaller, so i found this little nugget. the Jabra worked quite well, mind you, but was a little too big of a gizmo than i wanted to sling up off the top side of my ear.the bluespoon AX2 is unbelieveable. it felt, literally, like it wasn't there. it communicated (bluetoothed) to my phone seamlessly. it communicated to me (thru some beeps and chirps) flawlessly.it took about three days of heavy use to get the 'set comfy in my ear, yet comfy or not it was always very secure and clear, both incoming and outgoing. it sicks in your via one of two (lg or sm)"soft springs" which are just soft rubber thingys that follow the inner contours of your ear.(this thing held on even when my own glasses fell off my head!) (thanks, slayer!)i've read about some charging problems in some other posts, and i hate to report that i'm having some charging problems myself. seems the mini-usb connection is not very solid, maybe due to the fact that the thing is made of lightweight plastic.the only problem i see with this unit is the blinky-blue light. it blinks once every 10 seconds when it's on. it blinks alot more when you're on the line. blinking when you're on the phone is acceptable, even expected, but you should be able to turn it off, so as not to freak out the general public. (not everybody knows what a borg is..)so if you're looking for a cheap, light, comfortable, reliable, geeky, borg-like headset that's worth every penny, get a freakin sweet bluespoon ax2 beeootch!
