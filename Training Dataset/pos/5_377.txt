I've have the BT250 as well as two other Sony Bluetooth headsets (HBH-300 and HBH-600). The in-ear design make for easier hearing, even in loud situations. The profile is also much lower-key, it's still noticeable, but not as obnoxious as others.I charge it every night, alongside my Sony K700i phone, and haven't had a problem with battery life. I use it regularly on my 120-mile roundtrip commute.One warning... I've actually purchase three of these because I broke the first two. The product seems very flexible, but don't try to stretch or pull them too far or you'll damage them. Don't let your two-year old kids do that either.
