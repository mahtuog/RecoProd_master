I received this little gem for Christmas and now I refuse to speak into the phone itself. This BT enabled unit is the perfect gift for anyone with a cell phone.No more complicated setups. As soon as I turned this on, my Nokia found it, recognized it, associated it, and I was speaking into it.The battery life is great and the clarity is also dead on.Once you use this product, you too will never go back to speaking into your phone the old fashioned way.
