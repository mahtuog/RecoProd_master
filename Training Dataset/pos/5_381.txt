I have been using the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 for almost a year now. It is pretty good. The only issue I have with it is sometimes it does not speak well to my cell phone if my phone is in my shirt pocket (left side) and the Jabra is on the right ear.Recently, I lost the ear piece so I purchased the Motorola HS810 to try it out as the Cingular store guy recommended it. I tried using the Motorola HS810 for about one week and found everyone telling me my calls were full of static and that they could not hear me.So I ordered another Jabra BT250 and am again very happy! Wish I could return the Motorola ...Michael Zyda
