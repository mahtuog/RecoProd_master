I purchased this case in an effort to find a case that looked nice but did not draw too much attention to my phone. Also, I wanted it to protect my phone. This case does that. I like that fact that is fits the phone perfectly; like a glove, and does not hinder usage in any way.Another plus it the fact that the case is clear. This, I don't know if it was intentional, allows for the lights to really reflect off of the case when blinking (messages, bluetooth, etc), making the phone visible and giving it a really cool effect with the top of the case glowing in low to no light situations.The case feels nice on the phone and does not hinder putting the phone in your pocket or anything like that.I don't use the clip that came with the case because I am not one who clips my phone on my belt, but if used, it may be a tad uncomfortable as it is pretty big.
