When I got my new Palm TX, I knew I wanted a hard metal case. I had one for my T3 that was really ugly and had gaping seams that were grossly misaligned. But it protected my Palm from all the drops and abuse I could give it. So after reading the other reviews on this page, I didn't expect much more than protection.The case I got shipped to me is really well made. The seams are tight and straight, the device is held securely, the latch is secure without being inoperable, and access is available open or closed to the stylus, card, headphone jack, power and hotsync jacks. The heft, color and texture are pleasing, at least to me. I don't use the belt clip so I can't comment on its functionality. Although I bought this case as a temporary solution until I could identify something better, I don't know what would make a case better for me than this one.
