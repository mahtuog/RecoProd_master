I've used a bluetooth headset before but never cared for it and had to return it because of the poor fit. The Nokia BH-600 has worked well for me. It fits well, looks compact and stays in its place. The battery life could've been better (it gives me about 3 hours of talk-time and ~ 72 hours of standby time) - my techie friend tells me that the battery is compromised for compactness.
