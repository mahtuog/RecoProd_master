Ecstatic about this product.Have taken the necessary precautions wrt avoiding cracking the headband - thank goodness I don't have a big head! Great sound. Good connection. Lasts for hours. Quick charge time (desktop & via USB).The best part of the product is that when you're out of juice - something that has yet to happen - an extension has been provided that converts wireless into wired (I use this when I'm at work so I don't use up the battery)iPod and the bluetooth dongle fit nicely in the headphone travelling case when I am using the headphones. And the case matches my VYPER! Only downfall is that I can't navigate tracks...answer? Shuffle.
