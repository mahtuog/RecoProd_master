I have a 6126, which I use mainly for internet access with AT&T; Media Net (web internet) prepaid service. I LOVE IT. I was able to install Opera Mini (free at operamini.com, just go to it from the phone) into the Games folder. I use this phone mainly for web browsing, and Opera Mini comes pretty close to a normal web browsing experience. I signed up for pay as you go AT&T; which means it took a month before I can sign up for unlimited Media Net. Still, it's been really useful even before that. This is a seriously good web experience for the price.Eventually I may need to upgrade my phone service to get tethering and the phone is capable of that and other things as well that I'm not using yet. So for me this phone will be useful for a long time to come.
