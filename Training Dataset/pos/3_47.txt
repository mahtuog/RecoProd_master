When I first bought this headset in April 2006, it was amazing. It held up to all the hype, and I love how small it is. Within a month, however, it started having volume issues; nothing major, but when I would answer a call, it would start out on low volume. Easily fixed by increasing the volume on the phone or headset, but it would do this on every call, no matter how high the volume was set for the previous call. Two months ago I also started experiencing the charging issues described by others. When it was charging correctly, it would charge from completely dead to full in 2 hours; however, now it won't charge for more than 30 minutes, and battery life is abysmal. I have to charge it everyday, and even then it doesn't achieve near its original 8 hour talktime. I still give it 3 stars, because when it worked it was an excellent headset, and still is for the approx 2 hours a day I can use it. I'm thinking about trying the new Samsung WEP200, as it's a similar small, in-ear design, which is one of the best features of this headset.
