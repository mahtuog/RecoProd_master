This is my second replacement battery for my cell phone. The last one didn't hold a charge very long even w/out using the phone. This battery holds a charge even when actually using it to talk. After a 4 hour phone call the battery still kept going for a couple more days w/out needing a charge. I am quite happy with this battery and that it doesn't need constant charging when in standby mode.
