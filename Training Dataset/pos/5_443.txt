Overall I am satisfied with these headphones, but the lag is very bad for gaming. I have tried different sound cards, settings etc. But there is always a lag that seems to range from 1-2 seconds. The bluetooth "dongle" that you use to connect seems to have an impact on this because I have tried 3 and depending on the drivers, reduced the lag. I have also tried this same setup with a Jabra and these headphones perform much better.A huge drawback for Gaming is that you can't get the HD Audio (Stereo) if you want to use the Mic! This kills me. I can't listen to the audio of my game in Stereo if I want to be able to talk on the mic for voice communication with someone while I play. As far as I know this is the most expensive bluetooth headset like this out there. It's also the newest bluetooth standard I beleive. I find this very disappointing considering I can't find any non bluetooth options out there and this is the latest and greatest...
