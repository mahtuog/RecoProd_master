Use these for skype and listening to music.The Hook up:minimac OS X - Easy install and connect. Only had headset connection available, so sound quality not the greatest.XP with Start Key USB BT - easy install and connect. Only had headset connection available, so sound quality not the greatest.XP via Boot camp on mini mac- Driver hell. Don't waste your time doing this.hooking to other devices via the 1/8" jack transmitter - works pretty good, with good sound quality. Some strange behavior every once in a while.. the headphones would drop the sound an let out a shrill beep sound until you turn them off and reconnect. Can't figure out why this happens only occasionally.Skype works well with this, just make sure you have a well charged battery or the call gets dropped.
