I purchased this headset and have had it for a few days now. Overall, in stereo mode the sound quality is very nice, and the range is wonderful. I can almost walk everywhere in my house and get audio on the adapter that came with the system. If your looking for a wireless headset to use for voice communications, such as Ventilo or Teamspeak, I wouldn't necessarily suggest this one. The built in voice functionality is sub-par for VoIP communications, but excellent for phone communications. It's still an excellent headset, and wireless is a god sent, but I am still using a wired mic for best quality of sound. If you have extensive knowledge of bluetooth, I believe there is a way you can rewrite the stacks to get CD quality sound in voice communications mode. However, I use a Logitech DiNovo bluetooth desktop and it causes extensive lag in communications mode when hooked upto my existing bluetooth adapter.
