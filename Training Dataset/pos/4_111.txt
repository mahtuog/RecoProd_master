This BT headset is relatively small and unobtrusive compared to others I've seen. It is easy to use, the sound quality is acceptable and it fit my ear comfortably. After getting it, however, I realized that I really wasn't in love with the whole BT earpiece fad (people walking around, apparently talking to themselves, with a big plastic wart hanging out of their ear) - so I rarely use it. The only real complaint I can muster is that it is somewhat sensitive to wind noise and best used indoors or an enclosed area. If you have abnormal ears - it might not fit as well for you.
