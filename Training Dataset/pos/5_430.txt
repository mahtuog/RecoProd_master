This is one of the few times I've encountered a product of this type that actually does what you'd expect and rather well. I have a Dell Axim X50v with built in blue tooth (and the necessary stereo bluetooth driver) and a Blackberry. I use the BT adapter to connect to my iPod video. Stereo sound is excellent, good bass, etc. Although the Blackberry has no stereo supporting apps, the headset supports mono just fine. Very good telephone clarity both sending and receiving. Love the retractable tube mike. One other important thing I learned after I got it (I couldn't find this on Amazon), is that it comes with a direct attach cable for use on airplanes.The only shortcoming is the huge, bright blue blinking ring on one earcup. Major overkill, and a bit embarrassing. But handy for walking in parking lots at night and letting everyone within 1/2 mile that you are there.Comes with a very good and compact semi-hard case to protect them during travel. One last thing, setup was completely effortless.
