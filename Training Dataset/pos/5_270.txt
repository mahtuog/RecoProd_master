i think nokias, in general, are great. this particular nokia is very good looking. very basic, also. dropped it about 10 times the other night (while talking about how i always drop/break phones...) and it has maybe 2 scratches on it, at most. still works perfectly. seems extremely durable, no dropped calls, no defects. those are the things that matter in a phone, to me. 5 stars.
