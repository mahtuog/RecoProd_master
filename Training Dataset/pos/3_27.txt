I love my Jawbone II but using the earloop was an issue with my glasses. I first tried out these Jabra EarGels and they worked decently. I especially felt like everything would fall out when I opened my mouth wide (yawning for example). Overall they were adequate and got the job done but now that Aliph is selling their own "new fit" ear gels I find I haven't been using the Jabras anymore. Aliph's fit my ear better.
