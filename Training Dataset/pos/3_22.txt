On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset. Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off. That was too bad because they did seem somewhat comfortable and did direct the sound into my ear for a louder and clearer sound. However, I returned them because of the poor fit. They would probably work well on some other headsets. If they fit your headset then I would give these gels a try.
