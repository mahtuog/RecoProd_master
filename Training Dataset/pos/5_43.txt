I have a Samsung WEP200 which is a nifty little headset but felt awkward in my ear. These eargels improved both the fit and comfort of my headset. I love that they come in three sizes for each ear so there's something for everyone. My only beef: $8.87 is highway robbery for these things! I picked them up at a RadioShack store for about $2; you're better off doing the same.
