I use a 2 line cordless phone throughout the house. Line 2 is the cell phone, courtesy of the extensis. Now, I can use my cell phone (via the extensis) throughout the house without losing a call due to poor cellphone reception.The only problem I have is that when I upgrade the phone, I can not get another extensis (since Andrew Corporation has stopped manufacturing these devices).
