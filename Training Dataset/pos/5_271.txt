As a seventeen year old female, I do tend to use the phone a lot. I got this phone without texting, and I still love it. I have no idea what the other users are talking about with the backlight, mine is always perfectly viewable. Maybe they just need a teenager to work it. ;PThe only problem I have with the phone is that I have a nickel allergy, and the metallic looking finish on the menu and surrounding buttons caused my face to break out with a rash, but as long as I use the easy-to-use speakerphone button, or get a good cover or headset, I should be fine.This phone was easy for even my 60 year old father and computer inept mother to figure out, with minimal help from me. I wish the record function wasn't so scratchy so I could record songs for ringtones, but what do you expect when most people can afford texting and ringtones.I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars, but as I can't a full five stars for this product!
