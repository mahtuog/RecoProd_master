A couple months ago, I had a Nokia 3120;however, I wanted to try something new. So I purchased a Motorola v551. At first I was happy I did so, but later I regreted it. So, I went back to my lovely Nokia 3120, and it compares highly to the quality and fondness of the Motorola. I absolutely love my Nokia 3120. It has great reception, great image quality, great battery power, and a great design. I have Cingular and I live in CA, and CA is renowned for it's bad reception and I still get wonderful reception. It is also a very low price.I highly recommend this phone.
