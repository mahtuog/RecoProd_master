I get more static then you can imagine. People think I cause the static somehow. It is a kick ass phone but the static that others on the other end is terrible. I have a 10 day grace period and will return this phone first thing in the morning. LG must suck for phones. Nokia and Samsung are far superior to this static phone from hell.
