Nokia 6126 - I used the phone for a year now. It is well built and does basic functions well.re: some complaints by others -Pl. note that there is no protruding Antenna in this model...it is embedded inside the phone(below the microphone). So if you clutch your fingers around the bottom of the phone while talking, you may feel call drop/fading.Battery life is comparable with other phones. Make sure Bluetooth is set to OFF when not used. The battery-life indicator is not accurate. The phone charger connector is an easy to use simple round plug, unlike the flimsy multi pin connector in Motorola phones.The camera photos in daytime are amazingly clear. Same with the any wallpapers you download. Understandably, low light photos/ videos aren't great.Bluetooth is perfect. It syncs up with your pc for quick uploads/downloads. I believe one could use it for music as well.Call volume is ok, bot not exceptional. The phone is long, so there's some getting used to for the ideal position for the ear. Note that most cell phone cases have only a tiny opening made for the earphone and if the case slides out during a call, it may feels like call fading. Use a small scissor to cut a slightly larger hole for the ear piece.Outside display shows the clock, which is useful. The camera button is too close to on-off button, not good. There is also a useful voice recording feature. Since I didn't use the phone as a music player, cannot comment.It may not be a trendy phone for the youngsters, but 6126 is a solid WORLD/ quad band phone. Buy a memory card and a case.
