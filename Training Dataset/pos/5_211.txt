functions exactly as stated in product description. i searched extensively online for similar cases and chose this one based on other reviews and price. no major complaints; however it can slide across smooth surfaces. i placed some sticky pads (available at most hardware stores) to prevent accidental slipping. otherwise, this case is highly recommended!
