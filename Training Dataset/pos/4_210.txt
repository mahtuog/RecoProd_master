I purchased this headset because I was having trouble hearing with the Motorola set I got with my phone. The headset was a snap to set-up, and it is extremely comfortable to wear. My old Motorola set had a tendency to flop around while the Jabra sits comfortably on my ear. Unlike the Motorola, the Jabra's speaker is designed to fit in the ear, which makes it much easier to hear. It comes with two sizes of ear gels, but even with the large gel, I have to lightly press it into my ear during a conversation in order to achieve optimum volume. It's range also seems to be a little limited, but all and all it's a marked improvement over the Motorola headset.
