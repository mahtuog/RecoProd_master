I just got this headset with my new Treo 650 phone, and it works fine. The pairing process is fairly simple, there are two versions supplied in the book to allow for different capabilities in various phones. I've never used a Bluetooth headset before this one, so I can't compare to other models, but sound quality and usability seems great.It does take some getting used to in terms of how you put it on your ear, but not overly so. I can definitely recommend this product.
