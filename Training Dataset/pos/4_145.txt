Here's how I rate this cellphone:1. Voice quality and reception: +12. Battery life: +13. Fast opening and browsing of menu and sub-menus: 04. Build and keypad spacing: +15. No useless accessories: +1Bottomline: 4/5.The other reviewers are right about the screen in sunlight: it sucks. But if you're like me and are chained in a cube for the daylight hours, it doesen't matter that much.The only thing I dislike about this handset, is that it is quite slow in opening its submenus. I would have thought that such a basic, stripped phone would be lightning fast; indeed, it was one of the reasons I bought it, but not so. Gone are the days you could unlock your phone and call a contact within a second.Besides this con, it is solidly built, has exceptional voice quality, and is easy to dial with if you have thick fingers.
