Bought these based on a recommendation from another site for a badly shaped earplug for a headphone I bought. The three sets (sizes) are really nice in that it allows some variety. The shape of these really funnel the sound into your ear, which is nice and helps with outside sound. The fit in the ear means that it will hold most headsets in your ear comfortably without a hook or other method from the headset.The nodule on the bottom fits over most earpiece sized rods - I've easily put it over one as big as a in-ear headphone jack and as small as the rod on my LG headset from work (which was far too small for every other one I found).
