Unfortunately, the ear gels in this set are all really too big for my ear. Not only that, but I can't figure out how to wear the "tab" that's on it. Does it go up, down, sideways, or at a slant to follow the "dip" my ear has just in front of the hole. And since I can't figure that out, & the fact even the small one is too big, it keeps slipping out of my ear. Thank goodness for the loop, or I'd have lost it long ago. Also, it becomes very irritating to the ridges in my ear & I usually have to take it off. I wish they still had the gels that came with the bluetooth. That one was really comfortable. This purchase turned out to be a lot more expensive than it should have been, since I now have 5 ear gels that I can't even use.
