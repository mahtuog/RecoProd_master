For a cent, why not? You pay for it in shipping, but where don't you pay shipping these days? The case fits around the phone. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't feel snug, and the plastic seems cheap; but it actually is. the knob in the back is at times awkward, and i don't use the belt clip. But mainly, I know the case will protect my phone when i inevitably drop it. I have one for my iPod too, and it certainly protected that. RECOMMENDED!
