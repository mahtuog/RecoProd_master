The LG C1300 phone from cingular is my first phone and i don't think that I could ever find a better deal for a great phone. The C1300 has internet acess, tons of ringtones, and great color display, along with many other features such as a calender, and note pad. This phone will replace a handheld. This phone is also a very ruged phone. i droped this phone in the pool on accident for 10 minutes and it still works. I give this phone a 9.8/10.
