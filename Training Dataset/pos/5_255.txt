Seemed a little light for a battery twice the size of the original but the original never lasted this long. After the first charge it lasted nearly a week. Don't have the ability to test if it's actually 1400 mAh or not, but like I said, it lasts a lot longer than the OEM battery did new. Great deal and comes with a new back cover, I'm quite satisfied, thanks.
