I really wanted to get something to protect my BB Pearl and did a bit of searching to find just what I wanted. I normally put my phones in my pocket which invariably leads to accidental phone calls or a ton of pictures of the inside of my pants pocket. Well no more! This holster is one of the neatest cell doo-dads I've found in quite a while. Very slick how it locks the keypad and puts the phone in to a sleep mode automatically. Plus the lambskin is nice and soft. Got a Pearl? Get this.
