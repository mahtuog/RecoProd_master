Bought it several months ago. It DOES work with my nokia gold phone. Works fine but the drawbacks are:No way to boost the volume on it any more than by adjusting your phone volume.Wire could be just a few inches longer.Rubber part of earpiece is breaking at the flex point.I don't know if I'll try buying this one again or look for one with a stronger design. Overall it was fine, but it didn't last that long before earpiece started breaking down.
