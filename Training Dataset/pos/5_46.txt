Product arrived much quicker than expected. I have a Jawbone 2 bluetooth earpiece, and I keep breaking the ear-loop, and I could not find replacement parts. Not wanting to give up my Jawbone (and rather not buy a new one) I thought I would first give the Jabra EarGels a try... and I'm glad I did! My earpiece not only stays in place without the ear-loop, it just functions better. I CANNOT shake it off my head. It actually isolates the sound better into my ear. With 6 provided (3 left and 3 right) finding the perfect fit was easy (you will need to use the original ear cushion in addition to the EarGel for two of the EarGels to fit best with the earpiece) - all and all... a five-star product, and company!
