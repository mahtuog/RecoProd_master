Overall, my experience with this headset is positive. The sound is completely missing low frequencies, but you get used to that and voice clarity does not suffer.Fit is very comfortable, once you rotate the rubber stub to just the right angle (different angles for different ears). I've found that 2 o'clock direction of the stub, with headset pointing at 6, works best for me.I had to exchange the first headset I'd received from Amazon, because it would constantly disconnect, but replacement arrived within a couple of days, so the whole process was very smooth and painless.
