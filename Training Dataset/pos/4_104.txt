I was very happy with the bluespoon AX2 performance and ergonomics but was disappointed with its durability.The AX2 is incredibly small, light, and comfortable to wear. The sound quality is very good and the battery life is the same or better compared with other headsets. The maximum volume is considerably higher than the Motorola HS850 and Scala headsets I've used.This product has two primary shortcomings: Wind noise and durability. I've used several bluetooth headsets and the AX2 is the first one that ever broke from normal use. The charging interface eventually wore-out, and I had to wiggle the AC adapter and keep pressure on it to establish a good connection after only 4 months of use. The buttons also became loose over time and lost some sensitivity, and the battery began to lose its ability to maintain a charge after 4-5 months (although this may have been related to the charging port problems).Outdoors under light winds, listeners often complained that they could hear A LOT of noise. I had considerably more wind noise problems with this head-set than I had with the Moto HS850 and Scala models.I'm tempted to buy another one because it was so small and comfortable...
