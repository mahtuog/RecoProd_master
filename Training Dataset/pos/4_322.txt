.....for all you complaining about pictures and music and the like, did you forget that this thing is a cell phone? So it has a 1.3MP camera. So it can play ringtones. If you want to listen to music get an MP3 player. If you want to take pictures get a digital camera. All of the complaining I read has nothing to do with the primary purpose of the device. Even the complaints about coverage is related more to your local area, not the phone or Verizon network in general.I bought this phone and Verizon service because we live on the cusp of a rural area. I've had Sprint, Cingular, and a couple of other carriers, but haven't been able to use their phones in and around our home due to lack of network coverage in our area. I found a website called [...] and found that Verizon owns a tower less than a mile away. So we got Verizon and we get great reception in our house! And with unlimited nights and weekends, and free calls to other Verizon customers, we never have to worry about overages on our plan.So do your homework and you can be happy with Verizon or any other cell company.
