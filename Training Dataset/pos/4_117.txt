I purchased this after having a cracked screen on my TX, and paying a bundle for repairs. The little screen cover was on it, and covering the screen. Apparently having the side of the TX pinched caused the screen to get broken even while closed. After I'd sent it off for repairs I immediately went shopping and found this case. Exactly what a paranoid palm owner would want.The case looks pretty nice, though it does add some bulk. That is pretty unavoidable. All the ports are very accessable, and even the speaker is accounted for. I'm pretty happy with the fit. The edges are a little on the sharp side on some corners. It snaps closed nicely, and seems pretty snug. The hinge juts out a bit after closing, and I can see the pin might start to work out over time. The SD cards have to be inserted backwards, such that the metal contacts face you, or it will push out the card holder, which will then make contact with the screen. My final gripe is the most annoying.. as noted by other reviewers, you can only lay the case open, like a book. You cannot fold it back, behind the palm, out of the way.All in all I'm pretty happy, and haven't seen anything better. It looks like it will work well. I just see room for improvement.
