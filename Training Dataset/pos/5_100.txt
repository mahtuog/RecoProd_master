Like most cell phone users, I had two chargers for my phone: The supplied wall-wart charging transformer, and the accessory mobile charging cord. The wall wart rarely got used- I'd have to find it, unroll the cord, reach down to plug it into the wall, etc. Not a very handy device. The mobile charger was much more convenient- if I remembered to use it, and if it was in the car I was driving. Oops, left the charger in the van. Oops, forgot to connect it. More than once I arrived at the office with a nearly dead phone.I bought this little stand on a whim, really, but it's turned out to be the single most useful accessory I ever purchased for a cell phone. Now, when I come home, I immediately drop the phone in the charging stand at my desk. When I leave the house, I grab the phone and it's always fully charged. I haven't used the mobile charging cord since buying this stand. I haven't had to.
