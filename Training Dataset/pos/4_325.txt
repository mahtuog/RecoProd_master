Ok the first thing i want to say is this phone is cut and very slim of course but there are a few things i want to say that arent good about this phone.It freezes up when I am trying to get on the internetWhen I close the phone it cuts off and Sometimes when you try to download the music to the phone it doesnt connect.Now the good things.I hve to admit I am just a little bit clumsy and I have dropped this phone on the ground many many times before and there is not one mark on it.I have also dropped it in water many times too but it hasnt been actingup at all.I dont absolutely recomend this phone but its kinda cool for a kid.
