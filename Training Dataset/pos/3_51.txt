I purchased this case based on the reviews here, and on my own prior bad experience with a Palm case. This case looks neat, has cutouts so you can use all the ports and plugs with the case closed, and has a neoprene lining that fits very nicely. The SD slots have a much nicer design than Palm's. The minus to Boxwave's design is that it does not fold back flat against itself; the cover just flops at 180 and I can see that being a problem. Also, the hinge and clasp are external, taking up more space. The belt clip, which I would never use anyway, looks like an afterthought that would easily snap under any substantial force.
