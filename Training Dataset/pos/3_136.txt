Got what I ordered...but if you are in a noisy place OR just driving down the road...it is so sensitive it picks up everything so it makes it hard for the person you are talking with to understand what your saying all the time...great if your in a quiet place not driving...(unless your car is airtight and not a deisel!!)..no music on..while your talking on this ear piece..I can hear the person I am talking to great...they just can't always hear me...
