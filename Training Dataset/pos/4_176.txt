Works just like the one that comes with the 8800, 'cause it *is* the one that comes with the 8800. It would be nice if it had a higher power density (which is achievable using current technology) so that the 8800 would last a bit longer between charges. High capacity batteries are available (sadly, not at Amazon) but make the 8800 thicker with the included replacement back shell.
