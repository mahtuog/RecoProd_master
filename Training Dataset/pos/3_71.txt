I had no trouble when installing my SIM card and generally it works fine, but I've had problems at times with it refusing to turn on. After removing and reinserting the battery it worked ok. I'm not thrilled with the tiny number buttons and the backlight doesn't stay on long enough during certain procedures. I would not buy this type of phone again.
