I purchased a Treo 650, which included the Jabra 250 as part of a special offer.It has good reception, but does not always "pair" correctly with the Treo 650's Bluetooth. In my opinion, once paired with the device, unless turned off, it should pick up calls when they come in, but the Jabra 250, sometimes does not, or has a delayed pickup of incoming calls.I also found the set up process cumbersome.
