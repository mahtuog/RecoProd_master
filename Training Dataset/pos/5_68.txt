I love these eargels. My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out. They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds. Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them. (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.)
