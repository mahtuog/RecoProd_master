The phone can ding up a little easier than what I am use to with cell phones. But overall, I am pretty sastified with this one. I love how small it is and how I can stuff it in a pocket or purse, or even just carry it around in my hand. The ring tones selection is good and the vibration is good as well. Most cell phones I can never use on vibrate, because I simply do not notice when the phone rings. This little sucker will let you know. Not a perfect cell phone, but no where close to being the worst I have ever owned over the last 11 years!
