I like the heft and feel of this phone and it comes with every feature I can envision needing other than a speakerphone. The buttons are large enough to avoid accidental presses of adjacent keys. There are three, count 'em, three buttons to take pictures. That is probably overkill. This is my first LG phone and I selected it based on the feature set but also because I've been told and read on the web that the phone handles weak signals well. So far that is true.After a horrible experience with the Motorola 720 which dropped calls faster than fall leaves and an experience with Verizon's highly praised customer service that I wouldn't wish on an enemy, (Let's just say it was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. Worse than the old Compaq Computer. Worse than Packard Bell (remember them). Worst ever!) I am pleased that so far the L1200 with Cingular service works better in every part of my home and city than the 720 with Verizon.I know service varies from place to place and I am certain there are locations where Verizon is better than Cingular, but here and now I am once again experiencing what I expect from a mobile carrier- a good product and good coverage.
