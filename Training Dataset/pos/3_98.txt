I owned the 250v for 3 years! and if the piece that held the eargel on hadn't broken I wouldn't be in the market for a new one. This unit is great, with some inconvenient drawbacks. First, turning this thing on and off is supposed to be a matter of holding the multi-function button for 5-10 sec. Good luck with that one....I never turned it off because I couldn't. Also there is a tiny blue strobe on this thing that let's you know its on. Yeah not a great feature when its stays lit constantly while it charges on my night stand. I can't speak for its standby or talk time because I charged it nightly and had a car charger for long trips, but I never ran out of juice either. Would I buy it again?....Yep, its too comfortable to pass up.
