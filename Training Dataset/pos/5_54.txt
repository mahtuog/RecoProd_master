You can avoid the annoying over the ear adapter and switch to a partial in the ear gel that allows you to hear the message clearly in almost all reasonable situations without high volumes. It does a pretty good job staying in place, too. I have used the same adaptor for years with my old corded Jabra and car conversations have never been easier. If you don't mind having something in your ear this is great.
