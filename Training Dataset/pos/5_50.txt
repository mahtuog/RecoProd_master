I have a motorola H695 bluetooth which I managed to adapt to use with the eargels, what a difference! I can hear better, I threw out the ear loop which I no longer need at all. The earpiece stays in very well. I use a large one with the bluetooth and I used the medium ones for my earphones which cuts out more of the background noise so I need less volume. The come with a set of three sizes sm med lg for both ears so you get 6 all together. Normally I have a problem with the earbud type earphones irritating my ear so I was suprised that the large eargel fits my ear the best.
