Used these to replace the painfuly uncomfortable original earpads on my Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset and they're a tremendous improvement. Great that they include small, medium and large pads to ensure custom like fit. If not for these I wouldve had to chuck the earpiece in the garbage. They obviously won't fit every device out there so you maybe taking a gamble.
