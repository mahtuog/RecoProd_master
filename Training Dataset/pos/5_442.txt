I've had these headphones for about 3 years now and love them! I've paired them with an HP computer, a Wind netbook, a Mac laptop, a Palm Treo, a Palm Centro, and an ipod. I never used the included bluetooth dongle but never had any problems with pairing or with dropping the connection. You have to remember the typical range of a bluetooth connection is only about 12-15m, no matter what devices you use. Contrary to other reviews, I have also paired these with a device that does not allow you to add a passkey code. Battery life is excellent, even after years of use. Headphones have held up well, but the head band (the part that goes over the top of your head) is not the most comfortable. Get these and get yourself free of those wires!
