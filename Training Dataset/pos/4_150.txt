The LG is a great cell phone. I agree with the previous reviewer, if you want a camera, buy one. The phone is small, easy to use, and has all of the necessary features you need. I also bought the accessory kit from Amazon, and everything works great.Bottom line: Great Price (free), great reception, small, easy to use.
