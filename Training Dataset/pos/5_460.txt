I've had my headset for almost a year now.I got it for the same price as you can get it today.....here(less than $120).I use them mainly for skateboarding, so they get put through the ringer. A fall from 12 stairs is not a good example of "careful handling", neither is the rather large quantities of sweat that they have to endure.I use them with my A2DP smartphone.I have used them with the adapter and my ipod, and I have used them wired on airplanes.The sound quality is good.The range is good.I don't have any cracks in the plastic.I don't have any charging issues, nor do I have battery life issues.My only complaints about this product are some design features.I don't like the left-right volume controls, they should be up and down.I also don't like the very large and conspicuous blue flashing light on the side. I look like a fricken moron. These headphones are supposed to make me look cool like James Bond.Minor complaints for a near perfect product.
