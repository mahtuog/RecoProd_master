This was my first bluetooth headset I purchased, and I made sure I researched it before I bought it. All the signs pointed to a great product. I went with this as opposed to another manufacturer because I wanted to stick with the Nokia brand. The pairing to my Nokia N75 was problematic at first, but that was only because I didn't do it correctly. Read the directions on how to do it. The build quality of this is exceptional. It doesn't creak like my new BH-602 does when you grab it. This headset along with my N75 are both bluetooth 2.0 so things sounded great while talking to people, and the range is good. Walking 20 feet away with a wall in between the phone and I, there was a little static, but I expect that with bluetooth. Sound quality is very good on all calls. People sounded very clear. However, volume wise, it could be louder. That's the only thing I saw as a downside, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. All buttons are easy to press and locate, so no worries there. Battery life on this is amazing considering the battery size. I get 7 days usage out of single charge on about 3 hours of calls with multiple disconnections and connections from my phone. I let it sit for 11 straight days, and it still had a charge, so I was VERY impressed. The specs say 9.17 days of standby time. This will beep if the battery is starting to get low also. The weight of this may be an issue for those looking to wear this for more than 2 hours, but maybe it's just me. It's not a heavyweight, but you will feel it. It's a shame that this product simply didn't fit my ear. The only time it ever did was when I had a beanie on and it was smashed into my ear. You can bend the earloop to your liking to secure it on your ear, but if you have a small ear opening, this probably won't be a good fit. If this were an in-ear design like a lot of others, it would be excellent for me. But for someone else, it might be a great solution. Great headset.
