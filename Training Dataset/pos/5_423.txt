Simply the best headphones for my computers that I've had. Saddly tho I cannot get them to work with windows. I've tried jsut about everything possible from registry edits to different software and drivers. Windows has no support for bluetooth headsets. However they work great with my phone and the range is great with both my computer and the dongle.
