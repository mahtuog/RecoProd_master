If you have had an issue with the Jawbone headset staying in your ear, purchase these babies and pick out the one that works best in your ear. Then you can attach it to your Jawbone one of two ways. First is the easiest, take off the twist ear piece and place the Jabra EarGel on. Put it on your ear and find the best position for you. Then place a couple of small (super tiny) drops of super glue on the EarGel and the Jawbone. Let it setup overnight and presto! You have a great bluetooth that stays in place. The other is to take one of the extra ear buds and take it apart and keep the ring. Place that ring inside the EarGel and glue it into place. Keep in mind you must have the correct position so when you put it on that it has the perfect fit once it is twisted.
