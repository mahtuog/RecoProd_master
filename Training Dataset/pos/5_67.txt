I purchased a Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset for my wife for Christmas. She liked it okay, but the OEM ear pieces did a poor job of holding the headset in her ear-it kept falling out, and she had difficulty hearing calls. I noted in Amazon's reviews for the item that some customers had bought Jabra EarGels to rectify the problem, so I took the suggestion to heart and purchased a set for her. As advertised, the EarGels resolved the issue: my wife now is very happy with the headset, and can hear calls just fine.
