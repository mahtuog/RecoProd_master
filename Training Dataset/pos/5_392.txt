I have tried other bluetooth headsets: Plantronics &amp; Nokia HDW-2 but this one beats them all. It has excellent battrey life as advertised and fits in the ear perfectly. I use it while I'm at the gym on the belt even. It comes with spare ear-pieces with different sizes. The sound quality is excellent and loud. It supports advanced headset mode too. A belt clip can be attached to the charger to carry it on your belt. Price is ok too. I use it with Nokia 6600 by the way. It is right ear, left ear switchable.Other bluetooth headsets are wheather weak (the ear-hanger breaks) or have short-life batteries. So look for these factors before buying any headset.
