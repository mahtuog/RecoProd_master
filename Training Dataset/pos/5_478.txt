After finding that my new BlackBerry Pearl did not come with a holster, I started searching for one on Amazon. While viewing another third-party case, I saw the little blurb that showed that most people that had viewed that item bought this one instead, and now I know why. This is the perfect holster for the Pearl. It fits the device snugly, is easy to use with one hand, is well-made, and just looks sharp. It has a solidly-attached plastic spring-clamp type belt clip that has a locking-swivel to hold the case in place at any angle you prefer. All in all, this is a great product and if you're looking for a holster for your Pearl 8100, I strongly recommend this one.
