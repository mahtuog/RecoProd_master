I bought my black silicone cover for my Palm Treo 680 from Bargain cell at a dirt cheap price and they were fast to deliver it to my door. The cover fits like a glove and keeps my phone from sliding around and helps absorb the daily bumps my phone gets.The cover is well worth the money.The only problem is that the hole for the SD card door is not larger enough to allow you to open the door and take out the SD card without taking the cover off or you have to take a razor blade and enlarge the cell phone cover opening.
