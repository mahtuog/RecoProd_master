The eargels are functional, but they are a little awkward to put in. I've been using one with my bluetooth headset, and it certainly improves the sound. The term "gel" led me to believe they would be more comfortable than my bluetooth. However, like all headsets I've used, the gels irritate after ~30 minutes of use.
