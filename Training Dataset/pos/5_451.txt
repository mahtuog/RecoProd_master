I purchased this through Amazon and recieved it the next day with free ground shipping (from Sacramento, I'm in SF) even though it was through a partner (computer brain). Seamlessly bound with my laptop (using included universal bluetooth adapter) and phone (Motorola Razr). The sound is awesome (good bass) for music and the user interface is easy for receiving/swapping to calls and back. Don't know about battery life yet, but it came fully charged which is a nice out-of-box experience. Plantronics is THE BEST in voice quality-- did some analysis for a job once. (They do NASA, Aviation, etc, so they know their stuff).
