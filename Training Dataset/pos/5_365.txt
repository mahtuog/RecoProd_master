I bought this for a Treo 650 originally, but now I have upgraded to a Treo 680. I have been using the case for my skinned Treo 680 for at least 4 months. It took a little getting use to pulling my Treo 680 out of the case without a protruding antenna, but I am very use to it now, and couldn't be more happier.I usually clip the case onto my Jean pocket, or a thin leather belt. Both scenarious hold the case in place securely. The magnets are strong, and I have never had either phone fall out of the case.I have had 4 or 5 other case solutions before this one, and this is definitely the Best!
