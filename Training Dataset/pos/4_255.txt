So I have a job where I'm constantly moving but fortunately can listen to music all day. The problem, of course, is that I'm happily working away and totally forget about the cords and wham! down goes the MP3 player onto the floor.The obvious solution? Cordless headset - so I got these and overall I really like them - sound quality is good, battery life is great, connection is solid, it works great with my phone and the hockey puck that attaches to the MP3 player at the same time, and the microphone is so good that people don't know I'm using a headset.There were only 2 problems, both of which are easily solvable. First, the adjustment thingies are too loose, so with a lot of movement and futzing around they will get out of adjustment. So I wrapped a bit of black electrical tape around them to lock the adjustment in place. Second, even though I have a pretty big head these headphones in their tightest position were a bit too big, so go down to the hardware store and get some of that black high-density foam that they use to seal camper shells to pickup trucks (the kind that has sticky-tape on one side), cut it into strips the width and length of the headband and stick it on there. If you're even halfway careful it'll look totally OEM.Plus, they stay in place a lot better with the foam.So I'm totally impressed with Plantronics - based on the quality of these headphones I got a bluetooth earpiece (voyager 510) and it's been great as well. I have a pile of dead bluetooth earpieces from Motorola and Nokia so it's nice to finally find one that works so well.
