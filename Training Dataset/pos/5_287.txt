I really don't understand all the negativity about this cell phone.By far, the best one I've ever had. I have had mine for six months now, and I have not suffered from any of rhe problems others have listed. This phone is reliable, powerful, and virtually indestructible. I have dropped this thing numerous times, (Blind folks tend to do that) and it hasn't quit on me yet.The volume is loud and clear. I have NEVER dropped a call, with it. In fact, I can get calls on this thing WITHOUT the antenna!If you want a simple, powerful cell phone, unfettered by bells and whistles, this one rocks!
