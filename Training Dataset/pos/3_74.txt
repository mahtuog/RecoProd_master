It does exactly what it says. you can browse and save your phone files (pictures, recorded sounds, Bluetooth acquired files) to your PC. You can also update the firmware with "Sony Ericsson Update Service". It can charge your phone but you need a charger connected to the dock for this.Now the bad part, it broke after just weeks of use and I didn't treat it harshly. It's just not working anymore and there's no sign of broken parts. Good while it lasted is all I can say. As with all electric devices, you can have better luck.
