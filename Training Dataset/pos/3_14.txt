I use these with my Jawbone 2.First the good: once you get the earpiece in place with one of these on it, it stays in well and is much more comfortable than the basic ones that come with the jawbone. However, there are several things that don't make these eargels great. First, they don't stay on the earpiece very well. It is very easy to knock off the eargel, especially while putting it in your ear which can be very frustrating. Each one of the 3 sizes fit differently too which I found very odd. Luckily the one I use fits better than the others. Second, positioning it in place in your ear takes some effort each and every time you put it on. This magnifies the first issue. And last, because these are a bit bigger than the basic rubber that comes with the jawbone it makes the jawbone stick out a little further making it a little bit more likely for the jawbone to separate from your cheek while talking. You'll find this out when the person on the other end says "what?" a few times.All in all these are still better than the standard rubber pieces that come with the jawbone. And for the price I think it is worth it. I recommend finding a way to get the eargel to stay on better and then half the frustration will go away. I think some other reviewers have ideas for how to do this.
