I'll admit that I bought this shape of Bluetooth headset because it wouldn't interfere with my piercings. It synced very well initially with my Sony T616; it only took two tries with the 'simple' instructions, and it doesn't get interference from other people's BT phones around me. My only real complaints are that I wish it would only pick up when I use the button on the headset, not the phone body; and that the sound is a bit muddy, though not terrible. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the T616 and my headphones, but I'd really like a bit more treble. Also, the blue LED can be a bit obnoxious, but that's covered easily with some electrical tape.
