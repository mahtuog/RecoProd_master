As someone else commented, the ear buds tend to fall out once in a while as they're a bit big. 4-stars only because I bought these for $9 inc. shipping but not worth buying if you have to pay upwards of $20. Buy an adapter instead and use iPod or Sony buds.PS: Haven't used them for making a call yet.
