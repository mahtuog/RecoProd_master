This is a fine product made by a good company, but it appears to have compatibility issues not disclosed by either Plantronics or Amazon prior to sale. I was told by Plantronics tech support that the issue I was having was a "known problem."(See quoted email exchange below.)Pairing Problems with ATT 8525Discussion ThreadResponse (Michael P) 12/10/2007 05:19 AMMaury,This is a known issue with the HTC devices.Our Bluetooth headsets are not compatible with HTC devices.Thank you.Customer (Maury Christie) 12/07/2007 08:22 PMHi, I can successfully pair my 590a Headset with my ATT 8525 (HTC Hermes) running WM6 Professional, but when I turn off the headset, I find I must delete the pairing, and recreate the bluetooth profile in order to get it to work again. If I don't it behaves like this: I turn on my phone, turn on BT, push the call button on the 590a and turn it on. It goes into pairing mode, but for some reason it activates the Voice Speed Dial application on my phone, which I don't use.Shouldn't the phone and headset recognize each other each time I power up the BT and the 590, once the pairing has been set up?Question Reference #071207-000440Product Level 1: Bluetooth Mobile HeadsetsProduct Level 2: Pulsar 590a & 590eDate Created: 12/07/2007 08:22 PMLast Updated: 12/10/2007 05:19 AMStatus: WaitingRegion: USAMichael1-800-544-4660 x74171-866-544-4660 ID#5471This problem is still not resolved.
