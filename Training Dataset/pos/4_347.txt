I upgraded an old phone to a Sync just three days ago; at the same time, my son got a Razr v3xx. In comparing the two phones, several things about the Razr prompted me to go back and exchange the Sync.The Razr keeps a subdued clock on the outside screen at all times; the Sync does not.The Razr is much easier to open with one hand.The Razr has voice-dial; the Sync does not.The Razr seems to have a cleaner sound for calls.The Razr is simply easier for me - an almost 40-something with no technical skills - to figure out. The screen icons are cleaner and the menus are more intuitive. I had the Sync for three days and still could not figure out half the stuff I wanted to. I've had the Razr for 3 hours and have already set it up the way I want it, including locking myself out of those expensive Media Net buttons. There's even a way to lock the AT&T; Music feature, but keep the ability to use the music player, which is in that menu, by making the music player one of the Navigation keys.Plus, the Razr is just prettier!The only thing I can think of that I don't like about the Razr is that the speaker does not sound very crisp at all. If you listen to music, I recommend headphones.Update June 2011 - I'm still using this phone, and it's still awesome. It never quits. My son has the same phone (he's now 17) and neither of us are easy on phones. It's simple, intuitive, light, and the battery life is still days long (we've never replaced the batteries.) If mine ever dies, it'll be a tough decision whether to upgrade to an iphone or just get another Razr...
