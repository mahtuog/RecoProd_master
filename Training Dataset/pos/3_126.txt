Highlights:- great sound in headset, except my voice does not come thru well- listeners report great sound from the mike- good rangeLowlights:- could not pair with home bluetooth cordless from Uniden but could with Nokia cell- voice call volume, even when set to minimum is too loud- cannot pair with multiple phones
