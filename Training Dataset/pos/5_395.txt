I gave one of these to my father (70) so he could let my sister (35) and mother (67)try it out on their EVO Shift phones from Sprint. About 4 months later he called me up and said he wanted 2 more ordered because he wanted to keep it for himself but both my sister and my mother also wanted it. He said it is helpful for entering information on his phone because his fingers are "large and dry" and sometimes his phone doesn't seem to know he's trying to touch things on the screen. I saw a review about it not working with the Nook Color however my mother uses hers with her Nook Color as well as her phone. She has reported no issues with it not working with her Nook. I have one and it works fine on my phone and iPad. The mini size is good for keeping it with us when we are not at home. I keep mine tucked into the case and very seldom use the ear phone port attachment. My mother and sister use the ear phone port attachment to keep it with their phones when their phones are stowed in their purses.
