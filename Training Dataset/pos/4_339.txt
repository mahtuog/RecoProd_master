I've had this phone for a little under a year now... Here are my biggest pros and cons:Pros:- Good, clear reception- Sleek, slim design (can fit in my pocket yet the numbers are big)- Decent camera (much better than my previous phone)- Good sized display- Time can be told without opening phone- Features are easy to use- Voice recognition works wellCons:- Smaller, sleeker design makes it easier to drop! I use a holder -- it makes the phone a bit thicker, but I have known several people who have cracked the screen or loosened the connection between the two parts just by dropping it once.:)
