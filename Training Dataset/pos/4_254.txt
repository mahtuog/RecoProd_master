What everyone is saying here is true !This is a real good stereo bluetooth headset and a must have.I got myself the plantronics pulsar 590 A a month back after doing a lot of research on stereo bluetooth headsets.- Paired it easily with my HTC cruise.- Took me a while to pair it with my Toshiba laptop, but thats only because I didnt have the latest toshiba bluetooth stack on my laptop. Once I downloaded that, rest was easy.- The universal adapter works well too.Some of you may be confused as to what the difference is between 590 A and 590E. 590A includes the universal adapter which you can plug into any 3.5mm output while 590E is just the headset.The only thing that falls short is the styling - Plantronics could have bettered the styling a bit - this has been around for more than 2 years now.(n thats y I'm giving this a 4 star n not 5)But apart from that everything else is great - Sound quality is pretty good for music (deep base n crisp mids), and Ive also chatted for long hours with the headset on and roaming all over the house without any voice issues even once.To sum up - great value for money !
