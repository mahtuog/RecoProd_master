I got new apple 3g .. That was my biggest disappointment. So Returned it and got this phone. This is pretty cheap and almost for free. This phone doesn't have hi-tech functionality like you-tube, bluetooth etc. Internet browsing i didn't try but who cares... you have to keep in mind that this phone is just for basic purpose.Signal quality is excellent. I get bars even every one are having 'no signals', very light weight and very good battery life. What else you are expecting as a 'phone'drawbacks : no bluetooth but getting handsfree wire device is also getting rare because of marketing techniques. Also I miss volume control buttons on side.but overall I am very happy and dropped all plans to buy any other phone
