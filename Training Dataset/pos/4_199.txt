The only reason I gave this tiny instrument a 4* rather than a 5* is because of the easy falling nature of this headset. It does not fit tightly onto the ear but just sits loosely on the ear making you feel that it might fall of any time , but not so the case majority of the times.Other than this I have absolutely nothing to complain about. It paired easily with my 6620. The voice and sound clarity is the best you can find. On one instance the person on the other side of the line did indicate the sound clarity was much better when paired with the headset rather than directly talking on the phone . Astonishing !Also the 6620 does give a indicator showing if the bluetooth headset is attached, so when you do press the answer button on the phone, you can expect your your headset to take control. The answer button is on the top of the headset which is satisfactory taking into consideration that its a wireless headset and given the volume control button, there hardly any place to place the answer button. No complains about that. The battery does drain but not as quickly as some have mentioned in their reviews.Looking at some of the neagtive reviews earlier I was very sceptical on buying this, but this headset has proved itself. It does however eat a lot of battery power of the mobile when talking, but that is common for all bluetooth headsets.Previously I did own a Motorola Headset and this one has just proved its a much better headset than any other there in the market.All in all this is a very good headset for the said price.
