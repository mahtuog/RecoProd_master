I bought the V191 unlocked quad band phone because it had the features I wanted, seemed well made and was offered at a reasonable price. It is one of the few phones left on the market without one of those dumb, little built-in cameras. I wanted minimal crap. The phone met my expectations. But the instruction book came in Japanese only. With a bit of help from the store, I found an English translation on line. All is well.
