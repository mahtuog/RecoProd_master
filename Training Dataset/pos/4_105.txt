AX2 is very unnoticeable and comfortable when you wear it. It is very fragile. It has slipped out of my ear several times. Once dropped you must put it back on the charge for it to work again. A negative of the product is the rubber piece insert snapping off the back. Once it is gone, there is no way to connect the bluetooth to your ear. It only comes with two rubber pieces and you can not reorder the part. It does come with two chargers which is a plus. However, over charging the battery can cause it not to work. Overall, I like it and it works for me.
