The battery appears to be exactly what I expected. I purchased 2 batteries, one for my phone and one for my wife. After full charge the battery is good for up to 4 days or more in standby. The price was outstanding (about 25% of what Motorola wanted for the same battery with their name on it, plus the battery came with the required battery cover as the battery is a bit thicker than the original equipment). The only rub was that the shipping charges for the second battery was the same as for the first one even though they came together in the same package. Even with the excessive shipping charge it was still a bargain.
