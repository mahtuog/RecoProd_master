i recently got this phone and my first impression was...WoW..this is a very small phone..it has all the basic features you need in a cellphone. text messaging, voicemail, alarm clock...if your'e a minimalist or starter, and looking for a basic phone, then i recommend this one to you. So far, i am very pleased with this phone and it never drops my calls, and my signal is always on full strength. It has good battery life, that lasts up to few days, the interface is intuitive because Nokia's are known for making cellphones simple, and at a great price. Also, the phone came the day before the estimated arrival date. If your'e looking for a good site to buy a good phone, then your'e in the right place(Amazon). ;)
