I've become a big fan of the game "Draw Something" and thought it might be nice to have a stylus to help me draw or write on my Galaxy Nexus phone. This stylus absolutely works on the screen, but I don't think it helps much with my intended purpose. The tip of this stylus is squishy, and for the contact to register on the screen, the tip must be completely squished. You have to press a little harder than feels natural. Also, the tip isn't very fine, so I end up drawing thin lines with the same unpredictability experienced with using a finger. I still like the stylus and perhaps with more practice it will be a superior writing implement.This does come with an audio jack tether, but the cord is too short to keep the stylus attached while using it on the screen. It's still nice to have to keep the stylus with the phone in your purse or pocket.I love the long length and slim line of this stylus. Mimics writing with a pen or pencil.
