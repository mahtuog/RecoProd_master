I'm using this with a Dell D400 laptop that has built in Toshiba bluetooth (Dell Truemobile 350 module that took five minutes to install- $26 on Ebay). Setup was pretty straight forward and it seems to work great for what I wanted. Two different modes really, a stereo music mode, and a headset mode for phone use. If there's a way to have both at once, I haven't figured it out yet, as I switch back and forth. The stereo mode works great with iTunes or WMP, with the track buttons on the headset, too. I have found out in that mode the bluetooth signal is more sensitive to walls than shear range. Walking very far doesn't work if there are walls in between. The headset mode works great with Skype. I haven't tried it with a cell phone, but that's where the two modes are supposed to work simultaneously. I'm very pleased- $109 with shipping, and it's everything I wanted.
