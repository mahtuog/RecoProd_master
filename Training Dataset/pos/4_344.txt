Some things people need to know about this phone.Good: it has a 240x320 screen and better video (can play mp4 & wmv, don't have to convert to 3gp.)Bad: VIDEO IS STILL 176x144!!!!! Even though it plays full screen, it records at this resolution and you must convert your videos to this resolution to watch them.Good: it plays mp3s flawlessly, speaker sounds great and it even plays them through bluetooth.Bad: listening to mp3s through bluetooth sounds like you are hearing them over a phone, however this may be a symptom of my bluetooth headset (Motorola H300.)Good: it has 60MB onboard and an expansion slot for 2GB microSD/transflash (same thing.) It syncs easily to your (Windows) computer through mini-USB.Bad: slow interface, and while you can access the microSD/transflash through USB (to upload/download mp3s, videos, games and pictures) you can't easily access the phone's 60GB (it can be done with third party programs but is not recommended.)Good: it comes with java games, and it's quite easy to add more games by moving them to the microSD/transflash.Bad: the games that come with it are crippled.
