I hate the phone charger business, and have gone through piles of third-party chargers over the years. With my A310, phone chargers would just fall out. So far so good with this one, plus the glowing tip (besides just being neat-o) makes it easy to find. I wish there was a way to tell top v. bottom in the dark, but that's not really a problem (and I've never had a charger that did).Highly recommended.
