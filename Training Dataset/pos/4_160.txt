Upgraded from the Nokia 3650 because I wanted a camera phone. Picture quality is decent enough considering it's a phone. Reception is great, all the time. I've had this phone for two months and have dropped only one call, early on. The interface is very easy to understand.My only complaint is in regards to the ringtones. The pre-sets all suck - the polyphonic ringtones are all too quiet to hear and the full-audio tones all sound like old video game theme songs. What's worse, you can't record your own and use them, as with many other phones. You have to go to Cingular's site and shell out $2.50 apiece for twenty-second (or less) audio clips.
