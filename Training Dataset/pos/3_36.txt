I got this earpiece after my $100 one broke with minimal usage. I only use it to call my friends long distance once a week or so. It does it's job well and the sound is good. My friends never really complain about the noise or sound while I am using it. I will say that it is annoying since you don't know if it is "on" or "off". When you try to call sometimes it will automatically dial the last number your cell phone has and it might not be the person you want to call. It also has a tendency to easily be turned on and I have more then one occassion called my brother a few times with it in my purse. That is just with it accidently having the button on the earpiece pushed and as I said before, it will automatically dial the last number it has on the cellphone. It does not "sit" inside the ear, but hangs from your ear. I have not had too much problems with that, but if you like to have the thing in the ear then this isn't the one for you. The color is nice and the price was really good considering how much they use to go for. If anything happens to this one, it won't hurt my wallet like my $100 one did.
