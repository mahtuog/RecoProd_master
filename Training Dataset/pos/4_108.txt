I just received my headset and it synced immediately with my Treo 650. Sound quality was great for the most part, and my caller's could hear me clearly. The small size is great.It was hard to get in my ear the first time, but once I got it in once, it was easy thereafter. Also the signal broke up a bit when I had my phone in my trouser pocket. I think the range is a bit short on the unit, but it wasn't too bad.
