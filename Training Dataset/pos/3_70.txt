This case is quite nice and feels great on your hip... but do not expect it to last you the life of the phone. I bought mine around February of 2006 and used it daily until May 2006 when the nub that attaches the case to the belt clip tore out of the leather and would not be reseated. I suppose some a hot glue gun would have made it last a bit longer, but frankly by this point it was looking "used" and was not worth repairing. I do not plan to get another as a replacement. I expect a case - even a cheapo case - to last me longer than 3 months.The best part of this case is the tight fit and the magnetic closure. Both ensure that the Sidekick II will never fall out on its own, even if the case somehow becomes inverted. I once spent the better part of the day with my case pointed open-side down and the flap open, and it was held sturdily in place. The case also protects well against the wet, and the various bumps of life.
