I purchased the 590A a couple of months ago and couldn't be happier with it. It doesn't need the adapter to pair with my blackberry pearl. It's very comfortable, and the battery life is excellent - the phone will run out of juice before the headset does. I am on the phone most of the day, and this is the first headset I've found that I can wear and use all day without having to make constant adjustments.The other thing I really like about the headset is that I can use it with my hearing aids (ITC style) without feedback. The earpieces sit on top of the ear but not so close as to cause squealing. The volume and clarity are very good. These headphones make it much, much easier for me to use the phone, and I'm glad I bought them.
