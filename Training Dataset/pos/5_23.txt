These EarGels make using my Jawbone I for long periods of time much more comfortable. I just put the EarGel over the existing ear button and it fits just right in my ear. No need to push and shove to get it seated and tight. Makes for a better drive when I am not always pushing in on the Jawbone to make sure it stays put. Great addition to any bluetooth earpiece that it will fit.
