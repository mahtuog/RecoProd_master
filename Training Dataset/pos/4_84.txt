Got this really cheap from BargainCell. Fits well over my Treo 755p and easy to get on and off which is essential as I have to take off the skin in order to fit my USB Sync cradle. The skin isn't as thick as the OEM iSkin I use for my iPod. And like the black iSkin, you can easily see all the white lint and fuzz it attracts. But overall for the price, it's a good value. SHIPPING: Ordered Sunday night. BargainCell shipped it Thursday (they're based in southern California), received Friday.
