In general I am okay with this headset, I am using it with a TREO 650 which lends itself to other issues, the headset is not advanced enough to work automatically with the treo. My main complaint is it is not adjustable to my ear. I actually have to use the big ear gel to get it to stay on because the part that goes over your hear is about 1 cm too high over my ear, so the big ear gel holds it up.... It fits my husband perfectly, so maybe it is that I have smaller ears, it just seems to me that there should be a better way to make it fit.
