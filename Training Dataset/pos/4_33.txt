I got these for my Jawbone as the included earpieces were horrible. The ear gels actually made the Jawbone audible in noisy environments. If you work or play anywhere it is loud, you need these! I have since upgraded these to a custom earpiece, but if I hadn't gotten the Jabra's, I most likely would have chucked the Jawbone as unusable!
