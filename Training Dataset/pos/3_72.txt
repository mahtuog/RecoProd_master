the first thing you need to know is that this phone is completely made it to be used in china. The phone offer some options that are made it just to be used with a "china phone service" (to name it in some way)Once you find where you can change the language to english, you will seethat the phone works great, it does what it need to do, camera, bluetooth, radio, 10Mb of capacity, and is a good looking phone.In my country (Costa Rica), the phone worked perfectly ... i could make calls, send messages and do everything your SIM card allow you to doit doesnt come with earphones ... just the phone and the charger ... and a lots of chinese manuals and one manual in englishDont expect a cheap camera ... expect a super bad camera ...so you got it, this is the phone you are looking if you want a cheap one .. i just hope you could find where to change to language faster than me
