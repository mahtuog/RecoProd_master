This is a must have for anyone that spends a lot of time in their vehicle. I had used all of the plug in ear accessories and they work well for short conversations and a short period of time. However, nothing compares to this. You place the phone in the cradle and thats it, it does the rest. While the phone is in the cradle, and the ignition is on, it is being charged. The phone can also be set to answer on its own when a call comes in and it will even mute the radio. I give this an excellent rating.
