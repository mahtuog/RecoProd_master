I'm an audiophile more than a cellphonephile. So when I was referred to this item by a friend, I checked the specs and found that this matched my needs and more. I was looking for a headset that could leave me wires and hands free to my iPod, however, this benefitted me a little more since I could marry this up with my Blackberry too. I've had it for three days now and I'm very happy with it. Below are some PRO's and CON's to consider when recommending it to others.PRO's- Much better sound quality than expected. Play with iPodequalizer and you get the sound that you want out of it.Don't expect noise canceling quality -- just enjoy the factthat there are no more wires!- Extremely easy set up to iPod and bluetooth phone.- Excellent iPod to cell phone call transfer ability.- Bluetooth range for analog far better than expected. Icontinued to get high-quality sound past 50ft.- Very light weight and practical to wear.- Nice carrying case.CON's- There is definately a lag in voice to video but it's notcompletely unbearable.- The analog adapter and headset status lights are a bit tacky.I got on an elevator and saw Danny Disco in the mirror withall the blue flashing status lights between the analog deviceand the headset. Just hide your pod and deal with the headset.- Big downside for iPod gen 5 - no track forwarding or back. Iassume it works with all previous generations.- Light weight headset means lightweight plastic. Take care ofit and don't sit on it as the plastic is that of cheapsunglasses.Hope this helps the masses.Happy consumer.
