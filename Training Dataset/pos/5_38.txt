I've used these ear gels on several products and have been very pleased with their comfort. I currently use them to on my Aliph Jawbone. They work well and there's no problem with hearing callers; however, if you think the Jawbone is difficult to get on with one hand you definitely don't want to add the ear gels and continue using the ear loop. Using the loop and gels in combination is a 2-handed endeavor and even then can be frustrating when you're in a hurry. I continue to use the loop because when I used the gel alone, I felt like the earpiece would not stay in securely in my ear. With the loop and the gel, the earpiece is snug and secure, even in the harshest (I drive a Jeep and take the top off) winds; and is comfortable to wear.
