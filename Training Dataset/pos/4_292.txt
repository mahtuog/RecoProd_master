Worked great (listening to stereo MP3s, microphone pickup, etc.) except for the car auto-answer after 5-seconds option. I thought there was something wrong with my phone, but I called Verizon and they sent me a new one with the same problem. I don't know if the problem is with me (looking at the wrong product), the phone (the new one was a coincidence), or the headset (whatever the headset's supposed to do besides being plugged in for this option to work). If there are any other Kyocera 7135 users with related experiences or know better please let me know.
