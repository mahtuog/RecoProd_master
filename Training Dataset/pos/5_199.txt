One would think that the makers of a PDA would have the accessories for the PDA down pat, but I wasn't impressed with the Palm case I saw in person. This case as so many advantages to the Palm case that it's hard to list, but here's the highlights:*Palm case only comes in silver-ish and looks pretty tacky vs. this case comes in black.*Palm case and many others are not snug with the PDA, so it will rattle (not with this case).*The slip tab inside the case helps keep the PDA secure, so even if the case pops open, the PDA won't go flying.*Very secure latch. (I have a bit of trouble getting the case open, but I have bad nerves in my hands.)*Cutouts for everything (SD card, headphone jack, power button, etc.)*The cutout area for the headphone jack is actually big enough and doesn't impede the jack.*TWO SD card slots on the inside cover.*Soft inside lining.*Doesn't add too much bulk to PDA.About the only drawback I can see with this case is that the belt clip might as well not be included and is a piece of junk, but that seems to be the case with other Palm TX cases and I wasn't planning on using it anyway.Update Feb. 2009: I've had this case for nearly 2.5 years, so I got quite a bit of use out of it. Unfortunately, during a short drop, the peg holding the PDA into the case broke. The case protected the PDA perfectly, and it's still technically useable. The PDA just now doesn't stay in the case when it's open. I haven't found a replacement peg piece, so I'm going to have to buy an entire new hard case to protect my PDA and keep it in the case. I'm weighing the two options.
